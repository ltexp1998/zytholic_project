       "'      oz can  funny story  as i finally walked in the doors after a  min wait in line and freezing temps the sweet sound of the grateful dead s sugar magnolia greeted me from the treehouse sound system  the bottom of the can reads   going where the wind goes  bloomin  like a red rose  a white haze to the yellow and golden liquid  thick and healthy  totally unfiltered  brawny white foam cap  thick  all white clumps  huge lacing left over  the aroma has a very zesty citrus hop effect  mellon and mango  grainy earthiness  tropical fruit blend with a bitter to sweet effect  then a peppery kick at the end  very aromatic  the flavor is just bursting with complex hops  zesty earthy tones  sweet orange  peppery malt  clean fresh feel and overall vibe  a crispy bite wakes you up  full and lush mouthfeel follows from a totally unfiltered expereince  the feel and flavor finishes with a fun  earthy  zesty dry bite  tropical juicy  zesty citrus  zippy golden wheat malt  melons  rustic earthiness sums up the taste pretty well  levels of complexity are deep  it s an interesting ride for sure  overall  this one stands somewhere near the top of the new england ipa s    classic th neipa  overflowing head and bouquet  strong flavor but smoother than     maybe peach nose but overall a general citrus punch     pours a creamy opaque light straw yellow with a whispy frothy white head  nose is of citrus skin and light pine  taste is a thing of beauty  a nice citrus punch in the mouth  both peeland zest as well as juice of oranges  grapefruit and lemon  nice malt backbone although minimal presence  you know its there because the hoppyness of this beer is perfectly balanced  meadium creamy body  smooth to drink  finishes with with a nice pungent citrus bitterness that leaves you craving the next sip to start the process over again  by far my favorite treehouse brew of the  or  i’ve had         pours a cloudy yellow color with a thin foamy head  head retention is good  lacing is very good  has a big juicy citrus aroma  nice juicy taste with a good amount of citrus and some piney resin at the end  bitterness is spot on  a little on the heavy side  but excellent  medium bodied with moderate carbonation     another great brew from treehouse       pours with a cloudy yellow orange haze with a burst of tropical fruit in the aroma and flavor  overall not quite as flavorful as i had hoped and the alcohol comes through which is a surprise  missing the mark of the typical th pillowy mouthfeel as well  consumed at just past  weeks  possibly past its prime                                       nice color looking like dark pineapple juice  citrus aromas and sweet peach    nice mouth feel and very hoppy finish  slight aftertaste     can taste the   but ever so slightly       might be max at one siting but still great offering   delicious     oz can poured into a tulip canned    a  pours a hazy and murky orange yellow color with a one finger creamy white head that has good retention s  loads of bright citrus hops on the nose  orange pith  grapefruit zest  tangerine  also notes of peach skin  passionfruit  mango   melon t  bright orange juice  grapefruit and citrus pith up front  followed by ripe peach  cantaloupe  mango and passionfruit  the finish is juicy and resinous with a hint of pine and pepper  lingers of more citrus juice m  medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel and a dry resinous finish o  juicy and drinkable  loaded with citrus and tropical fruity hops    hazy ne ipa golden color  foamy head that quickly disappears  juicy explosions at first pour  smooth taste  little after taste  not too hoppy  good mouth feel  some creaminess yet too much lingering feel  overall great offering from th  easy to drink everyday               what a good beer  crisp clean taste of an ipa without the lingering aftertaste so common with ipas  the beer felt  full  in the mouth without a syrupy or slimy texture  smell was nice and pleasant with a lite hop grain aroma      can dated      about  weeks old  which may influence the review  i e  hop flavor has faded a bit  pours a very cloudy  vibrant orange gold color with a  finger fluffy head that leaves nice lacing as it dies down  aroma has fragrant notes of orange and nectarine and some pine  not too strong but very present  as it warms up a little more alcohol comes through on the nose  the taste follows the smell closely with the hop flavor up front giving way to a light maltiness midway through and finishing off with a nice buzz on the tongue with a bit of tartness and residual sweet hop  the flavor has a little white pepper to it as well  the feel is smooth and soft with a little seltzer  it is a little sticky on the lips as well  clearly a great neipa  the tartness is an interesting take on it and definitely works well  there are many other neipas i would be happier to have before this one but i wouldn t kick it out of bed by any measure          decanted from a  oz   ml  can into a tree house snifter  produced on       three days ago  a  pours a very cloudy  bright  light orange color with a one inch head  good retention  and robust lacing  s  the fragrance reaches out to the nose from a distance while decanting  aromas of mango  orange  pineapple  and peach predominate  pepper pine spice notes  t  largely follows the nose with flavors of peach and orange dominant  bitterness kicks in slowly  leading to a refreshing finish  m  medium bodied with solid carbonation  creamy and smooth  o  this is really a great new england style dipa  honestly the best that i have had  certainly worth a trip to the brewery       goodness  me  a gift from a friend  just back from western ma  i thought it looked a little light   a beautiful  bright  luminous light orange  hazy as the name suggests  but it seemed pale for the stats  everything else  though  ripping fruits on the nose  this drinks like the most perfectly balanced mimosa   fresh squeezed orange juice and kinetic effervescence   it s impossible to connect this beer with its alcohol content until after you ve finished it  it is just so light  and so lovely  soft and creamy on the tongue  it leaves the exactly perfect trail of crisp bitterness on the release  i loved this beer  very close to the best one i ve ever had  i think  i was shattered when it was gone     canned  days ago  l — see  name s — orange  cream  chalky yeastiness  mango  guava  and  interestingly  a touch of spirulina chlorella t — peach and orange dominate the palate  reminds me more of julius than green  but has less of that orange creamsicle quality  also getting pineapple  papaya  mango  and white bready malts f — smooth  gently creamy  fluffy texture  medium  mouthfeel  medium carb  immensely smooth and drinkable for the abv  practically no bitterness  save for a slight tea like quality between sip and finish  semi sweet o — even though it doesn’t quite top the perfection that is julius green  this is still my favorite dipa to date  i simply cannot believe that this is    abv  drinking blind  i would guess      edit       week old can  reaffirming all above notes  it is so hard to not chug this  straight peach juice   do you really need another review  what’s not to like here        near opaque light orange pour  dare i say hazy  thumb sized head  good retention  lacing  aroma of melon  orange  peach  orange juice up front  very light dankness  pineapple  canteloupe  peach  medium body  smooth mouthfeel  perfect for this type of beer  damn          what beautiful beer  l  the name calls it  lovely orange cold  thick as juice and cloudy as glacial runoff  s  there s orange but also tropical fruit  i picked up a pine scent similar to how the pith of a mango has pine  t  juice comes first and    wow  what took me by surprise is that the malt is detectable  too  f  just so damned smooth  again  like glacial runoff  but juicy instead  o  worth seeking this out via a trade  poured from a can to a tulip glass  had side by side with spirit crusher  a similarly hazy dipa from seattle s holy mountain  also from a can created about the same time  an interesting east west experiment with both winning  in my opinion  the new england beer predictably nailed its own style with the aptly named haze  and the west coast brew brought washington state hops to the table in a very similar style  i d say spirit crusher might ve been even more orange juicier  just in the way that it was more like orange juice concentrate  maybe more hop bite  too  like tasting a hop off the vine   haze  may have been slightly more refined  which is odd to say because both have punch and smoothness  balance  and surprisingly similar beers         a  hazy  surprise surprise  bright burnt orange color  there is a very vibrant caramel color in here as well which looks just like one of those caramel candies  head pours  fingers  solid bright white  it settles to about   finger pretty quickly though s  pineapple  mango  and apricot up front   very juicy  behind that is a big sweet malt aroma along with a slightly bready presence  which is making up the backbone of the beer  there is a hint of some herbal hops in here as well as a sweet citrus smell towards the end  this smells juicy and sweet t  pineapple  kiwi  and juicy melon are the two flavors in here that hit you right away  behind that is a big hit of sweet malts  with just a touch of syrupy sugar that you get in most dipa s  bitterness in here is very muted  and there is just a tiny touch of pine on the sides of the tongue  the finish is sweet  with just a hint of booze m  medium mouthfeel  but not as syrupy sticky as many dipa s  carbonation level is somewhat low o  interesting take on a dipa here  for me  the melon in the flavor makes this quite a refreshing beer  and the fact that the mouthfeel isn t sticky makes this highly drinkable  it is a bit lighter in the mouth  but that gives it a unique quality  be careful with this one  it will sneak up on you       woahhh this one had way more dankness than any of the other th beers ive tried  up front there is some juicy orange and a hint of stone fruits  definitely getting that peppery spice and some bitterness reminiscent of grapefruit peel and pine needles on the finish     everything is pretty mellow and blends together except this massive dankness throughout  mouthfeel is on point  overall very enjoyable and quite different than most th to my taste                  look  thick pineapple juice with a little oj thrown in as well smell  nice and airy  got whiffs of peach  mango  orange  a bit of pepper undertones taste  really nice sweetness  starts off with melon and earthiness  flavor crescendos into sweetness like biting into a juicy peach  you can taste the hoppiness of this beer without a major bite  it s really enjoyable feel  carbonation and fullness really shine  tree house is known for creaminess  this may be the best they offer in this regard  overall  a real sleeper  very drinkable  the feel as good as anything out there  just quality  not my favorite but i can understand why it would be someone s  a dark horse         great head  but a little too sweet for my taste   pours a matte light yellow orange color  looks like oj  completely opaque  thick frothy white head dissipates steadily leaving a residual thin layer of foam and lots of sticky white lacing behind  for the ne style ipa this is an excellent appearance  smell is pungent and permeating   strong notes of orange  tangerine  peach  mango and passionfruit all are noted  taste follows the nose with lots of strong citrus flavors   orange  tangerine  and grapefruit   along with some peach and mango initially  quickly transitions to some english biscuit like malt  some grassy hop notes  and dry hopped flavors  almost no bitterness although you certainly get lots of hops flavors  feel is medium to full bodied  thick  yet extremely drinkable  moderate carbonation is perfect for the heft of this beer  smooth dry finish  overall this is a fantastic ne style ipa from tree house  certainly lives up to the expectations    oz can dated     pours cloudy  opaque gold with a short lived head of tight white  minimal lacing or retention  aromatics are lush with fresh peach and orange sherbet  medium bodied with a creamy  soft mouthfeel  peaches  orange  and candied grapefruit on the palate  minimal bitterness  zero malt  and quite dry  finishes with lingering tropical fruit  great beer  loads of peach character  very smooth  and insanely drinkable for such a hop bomb        favorite ipa from tree house              lovely stuff  orange and peach  a touch of passionfruit  a bit of a oily  herbal flavour  pretty mild bitterness  malt is very restrained  creamy and smooth  alcohol very well hidden  beautiful  a real pleasure to drink         oz can  purchased from the brewery  not sure the date  but known to be very fresh  poured into a tree house snifter glass  enjoyed on     reviewed from tasting journal  the beer pours a very turbid golden color with orange hues that is very reminiscent of a glass of orange juice  a thick finger of white head rises with good retention and lots of spotted lace  the aroma is very nice  lots of citrus  orange and grapefruit with some tropical pineapple  a bit of wildflower  sweet yeast  pale dough and some dank pine at the finish  the flavors really explode  lots of bitter pine up front  grassy hops  hop spice  grapefruit peel offer some more spicy bitterness with some refreshing tropical fruit juice with a sweet finish  pale grain  lightly yeasty  the mouthfeel is great  coating  creamy  medium body that has nice life to it with a dry and bitter finish  verdict  a very nice dipa from tree house  refreshing  bursting with flavor  well balanced  and as it warms  some pleasant bitterness comes out to contrast against the sweeter nature of the this beer which is much needed     a   nice murky golden orange amber color with a thick white head that sticks s   big peach  pineapple  mango  papaya  passion fruit  very  soft  smelling t   peach  papaya  mango  passion fruit  again very soft tasting  little bit of hop resin grapefruit  has a creamy flavor it their too  it s like the whole milk of beer  m   light to medium mouthfeel  very soft feeling  alcohol completely covered  feels more like    alcohol if that  aftertaste is is peach  passion fruit  papaya  o   amazing  it definitely brings me back to when i first tried sap and julius  it showcases that  tree house flavor that really doesn t exist anyplace else    very cloudy straw appearance with white head that disipates quickly  nice balanced aroma of citrus and hops  taste is also a very smooth balance of hops and citrus        had this recently   overall another tree house masterpiece           tasted from can  pours a cloudy gold with thick rocky white head  incredible fruity aroma  lots of orange with some grapefruit and lemon  incredibly balanced  flavors of orange  peach  grapefruit  pineapple with some floral and resin notes  extremely drinkable  incredible ipa      thanks goes out to colby for this brew  again   oz  can canned on     poured into a tired hands glass a very nice hazy yellow color  very nice carbonation  with a very nice thick creamy one finger plus off white head  which also leaves some very nice creamy sticky lacing behind  the nose is hoppy  malty  very nice citrus complex  orange  tangerine  peach  grapefruit  lemon   with some nice diesel like  the taste is very nice hoppy  malty  very nice citrus comple  orange  tangerine  peach  lemon  grapefruit  nice diesel like  medium body  abv hidden very very well  with a very nice little dry bitter finish  overall  this is a very very tasty brew  addictive  milkshake  thanks bill    fresh can from the brewery  super excited to get this on the random day i was heading to th  i was surprised how similar this is to julius  pours a very hazy pale orange like watered down orange juice  medium head that has very good retention and tons of lace sticking everywhere  unlike some murky ne ipas  this remains bright despite being super hazy  nose is slightly bigger than julius  but still didn t quite match what i expected based on what i d previously heard  nice orange zest  some tropical notes  and certainly yeastier than i expected  taste is a little bolder with durian being the main fruit i get  plenty of citrus and again that yeasty note  mouthfeel is really pleasant and soft while still popping on the tongue like citrus pop rocks  overall  a great beer that didn t quite match the hype but was still a great experience       canned    deep orange with an inch and a half head that left nice lacing the whole way down the glass  smell was a bit muted from what i was expecting but you get a nice nose full of papaya and peach plus a hint of grass onion  some orange comes out as well but more so from when it is in the can than the glass  tastes of pine  grapefruit  melon with a bitter backbone  remarkably smooth despite the bitterness  very soft  modestly carbonated  no way you would know this is     no doubt one of the best beers i ve had in my life  treehouse is a hike for me but  this one was well worth the drive  if you have it  treasure it  if you don t  make the effort to get your hands on this                 from fresh  oz can  for a north east dipa where s none better then this  overall a near perfect beer      sampling my first tree house beer  excited to check out the hype and experience the brewery  have some cans of other examples waiting for me  pouring the can cold into a snifter  the beer is a cloudy orange juice color with no light passing through my glass  a bleached white creamy head of  cm rests on the surface of my glass and remains as a sturdy surface layer throughout the sampling  the foam leaves dense lattice on the sides of my glass after each sip  aroma is lots of fruit with some peach and apricot mixing with grapefruit and some orange as well  a little bit of rindy pith scents but otherwise fairly sweet and fruity on the nose  the first sip reveals a light body with very tingly carbonation and a smooth texture  the beer drinks very easy and is physically no challenge to consume  the flavor is all hops with lots of fruit notes throughout the sampling  i get hits of peach and grapefruit and then the middle is pithy citrus rind and slightly bitter flavor  this gives way quickly to a very orange flavor that is fairly sweet and lingers citrus on my palate  i do get sort of bready and creamsicle flavored burps occasionally but i dont get any detection of the    on the can  very drinkable brew and definitely depicting juice characteristic throughout the stages of sampling  definitely worth trying if ne ipa ne dipa is your thing  but also pretty enjoyable for anyone       smell of pineapple and mango juice  almost like drinking a blend of grapefruit and orange juice  creamy body turns a bit dry in the finish  this is a lovely brew with almost no hop protein burn  worth the hype         we got you stuck off the real ness  we be the infamous  you heard of us  official queensbridge murderers  the mob come equipped for warfare beware  and so on and thusly  in addition to the opening to shook ones pt    all i can say about this beer is fantastic execution       look  yellow  turbid  hazy  with  inch white head  medium low carbonation  smell  candy  grapes  melon  and blueberry  taste  grapes  candy  bubblegum  and blueberries  mouthfeel  medium to light  silky smooth  overall  an outstanding ipa from treehouse             such an extraordinary beer  poured from the can into a teku  pours a thick  smoothie yellow  the nose and palate are bursting with tropical fruit  and there s an amalgamation of sweet citrus and hop here that works beautifully  not many beers hit this level of excellence         smell  fresh squeezed orange juice  fresh peach  papaya  tangerine  mango  yellow grapefruit  bubblegum  a little bit of a green note  no real malt presence  it smells like a fruit smoothie  taste  right upfront your smacked with fresh squeezed orange juice and juicy tangerine  middle of the mouth tropical fruits come in to play peach flesh  mango  papaya a little bit of passionfruit the flavors in the mid plate play with the creaminess of the beer to give it a fresh picked tropical fruit salad taste  the beer finishes with more of those citrus notes  yellow grapefruit and orange  some bubblegum  along with a light grassy earthy bitterness  feel  medium body  moderate to full creaminess  super soft  the beer just glides across the plate  overall  drinking this i can understand the treehouse hype  the hops in this beer are used to make a fruit bomb  the creaminess in the beer gives it a fruit smoothie like flavor in the mid plate  almost no bitterness or malt presence  this is an a  beer  one of the best double ipa s out there     this was poured into a tulip  the appearance lived up to it’s name  definitely orange haziness colored with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that leveled off at a nice pace  sly thin lacing forms around the sides evenly  the aroma starts off with a bright and juicy orange juice  pulpy with big bitter balancing rind like qualities  sweet onion dankiness slides in for an extra ferocity of the aroma  the flavor brings it all together bittersweet with a spectacular orange juice to sweet onion aftertaste  excellent sweet to danky finish  on the palate  this one sat about a medium in body with a smooth sweet to bitter feel rolling over my tongue  nothing clings  just feels absolutely awesome as it hits my tongue  overall  hot damn  what an absolutely amazing dipa  i would definitely have again       pours a very opaque lightly orange tinged pale   nice head that leaves massive lacing  aroma is juicy and tropical  some underlying biscuit  flavor and mouthfeel are delightful  smooth and rich with nice bitterness  tasty beer            very delicious ipa  it s amazing that it s over    alcohol considering you barely taste the hoppiness of the ipa        pours a hazy dark orange  with soft  fluffy foam  smell is very tropical  main notes are peach  papaya and grapefruit  taste is a total juice bomb  peach  pineapple  papaya  grapefruit and a hint of dankness blends superbly with a perfect amount of bitterness  as all tree houses  soft and pillowy mouthfeel  terrific juice bomb of a dipa  very drinkable  with no hint of the abv  another winner by tree house       got this bad boy in a trade  can t wait to try it  poured into a tulip glass from a  pint can     abv  bottled date     look  pours a beautiful opaque gold  thin white head of foam  heavy lace  smell  intense piney aromas right away  but with a subtle sweetness that creeps up on you  distinct notes of tangerine and grapefruit also clearly present  update  emergence of guava in the smell  not easily noticeable right away  but very apparent in the back of the nose  amazing  taste  again  very hop forward but equally matched in flavor by an intensely bitter grapefruit balance that is unmistakable  feel  incredibly smooth and drinkable  i would never guess that the abv clocked in at     this beer is truly unique and incredible  it pours an amazing golden color and the smell is subtle but so potent  at first  with such an amazing look and smell  the mild flavors almost took me back  but after a few more sips and a bit of warmth  it really transformed  can t get over how smooth this dipa is  really remarkable  there s a reason tree house stands tall among american craft breweries  get it if you can      simply  the is a jacked up julius        hands down the most drinkable    beer i ve ever tasted  only surpassed by very hazy  the smell is great  feel is excellent  the look is outstanding   as the name describes  this is the absolute perfection of the hazy look  taste is sweet  but not overbearing in the slightest  and aggressively hopped  world class  my favorite th beer                           juicy af        this beer is exceptional  uniform peach haze with half finger of white head  not murky  their description is spot on with orange  peach  and passion fruit all present  overall awesome  flavor and mouthfeel make the beer  aroma could come out a little more maybe and then it would be perfect           p  acquired through a trade  on south shore beer exchange  poured from a  oz can into a cigar city spiegelau ipa glass date on the can is     l  thick soapy white colored head with good retention and sticky lacing after the head fades away it leaves thick fluffy patching deep hazy straw   yellow colored body with low clarity and only distorted light showing through the glass low amount of carbonation and heavy amount of sediment  s  on the nose i get sweet orange juice fresh peaches papaya mango and pineapple fruit notes trace elements of bitter pine hops and bright biscuit malts this is a very hop forward beer mostly consisting of tropical fruits  t  the palate follows the nose with orange juice papaya fresh peaches mango and pineapple from the beginning till the end the palate finishes off with slight flavors of bitter pine that lingers with a sweet biscuit malt balance this is one of those  juice bomb  ipa s i have been patiently waiting to try it did not disappoint at all  f  the mouth feel is medium heavy with a very sticky yet smooth and silky texture low amount of oxidation on the tongue smooth on the finish with just a small hint of dryness  o  i really don t know where to start with this one this ipa is mind blowing it is super juicy on the nose and the palate with a perfect balance of bitter pine i just wish tree house wasn t so far away otherwise i would drink this beer all the time trying this makes me very excited  to try some of their other offerings if you love a good new england ipa   juice bomb try and get this beer by any means necessary this beer is pretty much perfect actually this is the best beer i ve had since i started doing these reviews cheers to tree house and cheers to the gentleman who i traded with to obtain it i hope you enjoy the wide awake as much as i enjoyed the haze             great beer  not sure how it s currently  rated  but it for sure is an excellent beer  what separates this beer from other stellar offerings from alchemist  trillium  other half etc    is the resinous finish  it finishes with a strong bitter  resin taste but it quickly dissipates  outstanding smooth mouth feel  explosion of hops and fruits in the taste and smell  excellent beer  well worth the wait        had this from a l growler  the look of this beer is truly amazing  almost orange in hue  the scent is also spectacular with heavy fruity notes  if that is your bag  i e  super fruity ne ipas  than this is the perfect beer  growler brew did go pretty flat very quickly  but this is probably not unique to treehouse brews    my th beer  look  pours a golden peachy haze  white head  tiny bit of lacing  aroma  a blend of orange  peach  papaya and pineapple  taste  it s complex   definitely need to have a precise palate for this one  tropical and stone fruits and some interesting yeast  feel  highly carbonated  soft and heavy  overall  i know from tasting this beer how good it is   but i can t figure out exactly why  it s the kind of beer that makes me realize i need to get a beer tasting certification to know what s really going on      pours a nice hazy medium gold with creamy head  the smell is amazing  you can taste mango  peach  pineapple and tropical fruits  so good            probably my favorite treehouse brew  excellent aroma and goes down even better  one a day keeps the doctor away      poured from a can into a snifter  canned     a  pours a super hazy  pale orange in color with a one inch  frothy  paper white head with good retention  thick  white  billowy lacing throughout  s  aromas of grapefruit  orange  melons  and guava accompanied by earthy  floral  and piney hops  t  starts off with notes of grapefruit and citrus followed by peach  guava  and papaya  finishes with a light piney  resinous hop bitterness  f  medium bodied  smooth  minimal carbonation  somewhat dry  o  overall  this is a good dipa  but i was actually somewhat let down with all the hype  juicy hop profile and flavor depth was somewhat lacking for me given the reputation  still a good brew  but i prefer julius and kj by a mile  also  if vh has fairly similar traits i have difficulty seeing how it holds a number one spot     great beer  thoroughly enjoyed trading for this  would love to have again can t wait until i come across very hazy      oz can  packaged on     poured into belgian tulip glass  beautiful medium gold completely hazed body with a thick finger and a half of head with great retention and lacing  this beer really comes through with the sticky delicious citrus and fruity hop aroma followed by amazing pineapple  peach  and orange juice flavors  mouthfeel is very balanced  carbonation on point and no alcohol to be detected  every sip of this brew was a delight and i m so happy to have had the opportunity to try a beer that emulates my favorite juice of all  orange            pours deep orange  nice lacing  aroma strong hops  taste hops tropical fruits peach mango and pineapple  mouth feel is silky  another beast  treehouse never disappoints       love in a can            my first treehouse beer  looks an opaque yellow with deep orange hues  smells strong of hops and tropical fruity funk  taste follows with initial bitterness ridden out by sweet flavors similar to the nose  probably the best beer i have had        pours a nice hazy medium gold with creamy head  good retention and nice sticky lacing  aroma is the usual citrus and dank tropical fruit but with a strong peach accent  flavor follows  very delicious with perfect balance and fluffy mouthfeel  no alcohol detected  this is a very drinkable beer for over   alcohol  another winner     canned on     day  fresh  peer down the mouth of the can and it s murky mango orange juice  a slow  deliberate pour summons a white pillowy foam which creeps up the teku but leaves quickly  we are left with a hazy tropical juice  the mouhthfeel is special  so soft  so full of flavor  the hops are miniature gymnasts tumbling on my palette leaving peach starbursts on the taste buds throughout the entire sip  i taste peach orange juice at the front end and then lemon zest and pineapple on the finish  delightful  haze   poured this into a snifter  looks hazy and with a little color of orange juice  the smell is amazing of tropical fruits  pineapple  mango and a hint of peach  tastes are almost as described in the smells  and has a very smooth body  overall  this was my first th beer  and really enjoyed it                             very good ipa  one of the better offerings from tree house  this one is more on the dank  pine side of the ipad spectrum as opposed to tropical and fruit side  i suggest actively seeking this one out only if you are a big fan of ipas        look  pours a nice hazy orange  the kind of look you expect from a treehouse dipa with immense juicy aroma  smell  wow  beautiful tropical fruit coming off the nose gives way to solid hoppy backing  very juicy  nice orange  mango aroma emerging from the top of this beaut of a beer  smell is on point with what you expect from this  taste  the taste is exotic  fruity  juicy  very very well balanced  bitter like a dipa but oh so juicy  the fruit aroma hits the back of your mouth as you re left with an overwhelming sweet  but incredible taste begging for another sip  this my friends  is the filet mignon of dipas  feel  feel is wholesome  very filling  smooth  and pleasant  you can feel the complexity that gets brewed into this beer  from the taste to the feel  this scores  all around  overall  the juice filled dipa proves to be a standard of what craft beer aspires to be  very  very nice  lucky to only be  min away from this gem of a brewery      had this on    in lititz  pa from a oz can dated          haze lives up to it s name by pouring a murky light brown  another beer that can completely block out the sun  note  a andersen does not recommend you expose your haze to direct sunlight   the flavor profile jumps between fruity mango and ripe plantain  at times throwing off vegetable flavors     l  hazy  juicy  lacing s  citrus juice  faint peach t  juicy  citrus and other fruits dominate f  smooth  great mouthfeel   slightly piney o  the juiciest beer i ve ever had  great balance with hop flavor           great beer  full bodied  but so smooth for its     smell and taste is fruity and dank  i could drink this all day   until it got me drunk  worth trying again  worth buying      another home run from treehouse  haze pours a turbid  pale yellowish orange  looks just like pineapple orange juice in the glass  a lasting one finger head  the smell is big beautiful orange  mango  tropical fruit  a bit of peach  taste follows the nose  orange  citrus  tropical fruits  just a touch for dankness hiding in the back  very soft bitterness  the mouthfeel is thick  creamy  like a velvet pillow of fruit in your mouth  overall this one of the best ipa dipas i have had  in the top  from treehouse for me  bright being my favorite  goes down oh so easy  no hint of alcohol even though it s    abv    poured from a  oz can into a tulip glass   month old   appearance is hazy mango orange juice with one finger thick white head  smell is tropical fruit hop juice that hits you in the face with notes of orange  peach  mango  and pineapple  some light resin and honey is coming trough as well  taste follows the nose with orange pulp most noticeable  there is a little bit of sweetness and low bitterness  mouthfeel is soft and creamy with good body upfront and a great bite on the finish  overall  this is probably the best ipas i have tasted  the tropical fruit and earthy hop flavors are unreal  yet the drinkability and balance are great  the bitterness is perfectly placed  and there is just enough sweetness  just about perfect all the way around         good lord  this is good  medium gold color  essentially opaque  tall head of white foam  lacing down glass    aromas of citrus and pale orchard fruits  maybe something floral about it  too    flavor impressions follow suit   orange  stone fruit  grapefruit   all with just a hint of muskiness    smooth and soft  moderate carbonation  drinks clean and easy   i could knock back a few of these with no problem       canning    can dated    ugly murky yellow small head smells like sauerkraut scallions lemon some tropical rotten notes some earthy notes tastes bitter like orange pith feels kind of prickly but also kind of flat i don t get the hype for this murky turd nugget                  canned  jan   aroma is apricots and peach with a subtle sweet caramel  palate is full of flavour and a perfect balance of dried apricots and a long dry bitterness    pours an opaque pale yellow with rich two finger head  slowing reducing to a film of bubbles  decent lacing  some alcohol legs  aroma is earthy over tropical  but full of fruit  lots of citrus  hints of peach and pineapple  little bit of pine and earth  taste follows the nose though the earthiness is stronger  little bit of bubblegum going on in there too  dank resinous bitterness though subdued  and a dry finish  mouthfeel is a nice medium body and smooth with higher carbonation than some of their other beers  overall this is a tasty dipa  the dank bitterness  dry finish  and higher carbonation place this above a lot of their other beers for me                the beer looks incredible even by tree house standards  it has that bubblegum flavor that a lot of tree house has but in this case it is a little bit too overwhelming                  first had    at home from andy k  smells tropical  and follows through to the flavor with peach and papaya  not much bitterness  creamy  pillowy mouthfeel with a cloudy  turbid appearance  could drink this beer everyday for the rest of my life and not be disappointed          poured from a  oz can dated    into a snifter glass  smell  all kinds of fruits in there  peaches  grapefruit  orange  mango  and papaya  a lite spice to go along with it  taste  all the fruits combined with a juicy flavor  the blend is super drinkable with no taste of alcohol for a double ipa ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ feel  next to no bitter with a little stickiness  just enough carbonation to add a kick to the drink  ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ overall  another fantastic tree house brew  i appreciated the higher abv as i drank my second one  super juicy fruit taste with little bitterness equals a very drinkable double ipa ⠀⠀   this and julius are pretty much the pinnacle of what tree house is going for    great beer  dangerous  ive never had a beer that was so drinkable at     i finished this beer in a heartbeat  felt more like a session ipa  in a good way         holy cow  this beer rocks            oz can  acquired from the brewery  as expected this beer is pretty damn hazy though the light does come through so all is not lost  perhaps one of the best heads i ve seen on a beer  smells of mango  apricots  ruby red grapefruit  and kiwi     pithy and rind like with lots of juice  super juicy  juice box juicy  very smooth with some body  a kiss of malt  hops are obviously dominant here  slight bitterness but it is soft  a bit pungent within all of this juicy character  love what they did with this brew  keep it going guys         poured into a snifter  a turbid golden yellow color with a frothy white head  the foam slowly settled into a nice firm cap  the aroma was bright   tropical fruit  grass  and a nice dank resiny smell  incredible taste with tropical fruit  mango  oranges  dank notes  and a bit of pine  a restrained but present crackery and bready malt backbone  silky mouthfeel    split a can of this with my roommate and good friend chris  who snagged it as a trade from his work buddy  cheers chris  i ve had the privilege of having several tree house beers in the past  but not this one as far as i recall  i think i d probably remember having this if i did   pours an opaque orange color as expected with a very retentive bone white head of foam that sticks around at about a finger with some splotchy lace here and there  the head that remains is very consistent and the surface of the beer bears it quite well  not everyone is into these turbid  milkshake  looking ipas  but if you are  this is certainly a nice looking one  very clean and well defined hop profile that straddles the line between tropical and citrusy hops very closely  not much malt here at all other than a subtle wheaty backbone that nevertheless fades behind the hop qualities  i get a lot of peach  orange  grapefruit peel  papaya  mango and even some ripe blueberry in here  kind of seems like mosaic combined with some older school hops to me  a tad bit of doughy yeast in there as well  on the tongue  this is super bright with candied citrus  mango  papaya and other tropical fruits up front followed closely by some more citrus and even a little pine towards the finish as a slight bitterness takes hold  i m surprised this doesn t drink like an    beer at all  it s very drinkable and even  crushable  although the idea of crushing this is almost blasphemous to me  pure orange juice in the middle  with some peach and apricot flavors lingering a bit before the mostly dry close  i say mostly dry because there s a slight flash of juiciness even right at the end  alongside a tough and lingering bitterness  just great  drinkability is  of course  very high as well  these guys don t really know how to make a bad ipa  and the combination of heavy amounts of suspended proteins in the final product and oats in the mash give this a soft  smooth feel with a moderate carbonation and chewy body  this doesn t drink anywhere close to    as stated before  so the alcohol presence is fairly muted and doesn t really play into the flavor until the glass gets closer to room temperature  even then  it s hardly as present as many other lower abv dipas out there right now  simply world class  love it           i suppose this would be my first ever  juice bomb  that i ve tasted  it was canned today  and pours really hazy  a very pale orang colour with thin white head  aroma is nice  very powerful  juicy  orange  mango  peach   also a hoppy floral scent as well  it has a really nice scent  taste is juice  i ve never had a beer like it  that tastes so smooth and flavourful  it hides its abv content and really just goes down easy  i do prefer beers with a more hoppy floral bite to them  but to each their own  really nice beer i m happy to have  skål   very haze doh  looks life pineapple juice  one finger white head aroma is huge  mango  papaya  pine  pineapple taste is lots of tropical fruits  mango  papaya  pine  malt  very hoppy  bitter finish but not overwhelming  so silky smooth      poured from a  oz can into a aslin beer co stemmed glass  canned     appear  poured beautiful orange juice haze with a about a fingers worth of foam that disapiated pretty quickly  gorgeous lacing is left along as you rock the glass  smell  holy orange juice rolls into stone fruit and topical notes some peaches and magoes great herbal and earthy dankness  there s also some candied orange rind going which is nice  taste  orange creamsicle on the palate  delicious piney sappy notes on the finish  there s also some of the same mango and tropical fruit notes you get on the nose  the pithy piney notes do build as you sip but not in a bad way  it actually makes the beer more balanced  mouth  some silky and so smooth  medium feel  i don t know that it can get any better  over  delicious reminds me of pineal by tired hands  great drinking experience     where it s hidden  could be    for what i could tell  very well balanced between the great silky juicy notes and the sappy bitter notes  great brew  right up my ally      had this out of order   so it may have hurt the review a little  i was lucky enough to have very hazy before trying haze  very hazy may be the best beer i ve ever had  haze is still awesome  treehouse again knocks it out of the park                          hazy as advertised  thin dissipating head  pine and mango on the nose  overripe mango and waves of bitter resin collide here and settle into a strong pithy afterglow  palate buster for sure  awesome tree house offering    sweet heavens  velvety mouthfeel  fruity forward  herbaceous late  everything i like about west coast meets east coast  nailed it                 drank the day i brought it home from the brewery out of a teku  the line at the brewery was stupid long  look  as the name suggests  this beer has a full full haze  deep bright golden color and half a finger of fluffy white head  aroma  classic th  big creamsicle aroma along tons of candied citrus  passionfruit and pineapple  taste  aroma translates to the palate  a little more green on palate than the nose would suggest  definitely a strong pithy bitterness as well balances the strong up front candied flavors  finishes with a good amount of hop burn though  the only flaw in this beer  mouthfeel  super crushable for     the strong bitter hop burn slices through that thick treehouse creaminess  overall style points   another amazing ipa from treehouse  killer nose that s on par w julius but the strong bitter finish slots it behind julius making this my second favorite beer from them    points         flawless   very nice dipa       oz  can pours cloudy opaque amber gold with a dense creamy white foam head  smells like orange citrus  grapefruit  mango  peach  pineapple  guava  papaya  passionfruit  berry  caramelized wheaty bready malts  mild spice  with dank floral resinous earthy herbal grassy pine  tastes like orange citrus  grapefruit  mango  peach  pineapple  guava  papaya  passionfruit  berry  caramelized wheaty bready malts  mild spice  with dank floral resinous earthy herbal grassy pine  feels medium full bodied  creamy and smooth with moderate carbonation  overall a really great juicy dipa              liked this the first couple times i tried it but more recently have tired of this ultra juicy style      incredible ipa  so sad that i was only able to get  cans  tree house in a class all by itself   good one here  didn t enjoy quite as much as alter ego and green  the aroma here was interesting  had almost a banana aroma going on  flavor is very fruity  hops are less pronounced  feel is medium full    this beer is amazing  it pours very cloudy in a tulip glass  the aroma is peach and grapefruit  the taste is tart and fruity without being overly sweet  the mouthfeel is incredible  treehouse simply makes the best ipas in the united states  everyone is a treasure    wow  just got it in growler for first time    this is amazing  the aroma is incredible  honestly  the only knock i have is some excess bitterness probably due to this being two months old  otherwise this beer was outstanding           oh wow  took a while for me to get my hands on this but it was well worth the wait  very smooth and virtually no alcohol prominence whatsoever  for a   very smooth and drinkable  a grapefruit ipa with orange showing slightly on finish  wish it could be a regular for me    great feel and carbonation  a smooth sipper that improved with it warming in glass           oz can from the brewery  this one pours a milky  darker straw yellow color  there was about a finger of a frothy off white head that leaves some lacing  very nice nose  orange  pineapple  peach  maybe some earthiness  the taste is excellent  a fairly good amount of bitterness  orange  pineapple  a bit of resinous hops  good malts in the background     pours hazy and looks like orange juice in the glass though tad more towards yellow than straight orange  the smell follows the look on this one  orange up front along with peach notes  going along with the balance the beer  the taste follows the nose as the nose follows the looks  sweet up front with orange citrus predominating  the back end is very balanced and not that bitter at all  notes of orange candy linger  the feel is medium thick  overall this is an amazing beer  orangey and tasty               drank it out of the can  smells awesome taste is smooth and fruity  would have liked slightly more bite  maybe that is the magic for     went down real easy  i would like to try this on draft  outstanding i really want to try this again    from a can dated             like other th pale ales  this one isn t much to look at  where it shines is the hop finish that is lacking in some of the brewery s other popular offerings  the citrus aroma isn t nearly as overpowering as it is in julius  green  or alter ego  the taste has a better malt hops balance  the mouthfeel and body are right on par with the best th has to offer  a fine example of the ne style pale ale    haaze is the best  normal  ipa th makes  it has a peach like quality to it  sometimes it can be rank though  i got a growler fill once and it was nasty  this beer must be consumed quickly after canning  overall  one of their better beers         pours an opaque fiery orange with a finger of foamy white head  head retention is strong with lacing prevalent after each sip  a low volume head is a bit of a disappointment on a high caliber ipa  especially a iipa  aroma is dripping with citrus  orange  and resin hops  very tasty so far  a sip provides a blast of hops  and citrus   in a good way  notes include citrus  orange  tangerine  and resin  the hops are well managed and balanced  keeping this heavy hitting beer from being difficult to drink  mouth feel is filling  while only be a medium to medium thick consistency  overall  it s a very pleasing beer that is strong across all fronts  the hops are well balanced and thought out  the alcohol taste is well hidden and buried behind a flavorful  powerful beer  served in a oz snifter    really hazy peach color with off white head  aroma has really juicy hops with nice tropical flavors  taste is even more intense  lots of peaches and apricots  mango  some pineapple and a good amount of grassy bitterness on the finish  full bodied and well carbonated  another great one from tree house      l  hazy amber  lacing is absolutely gorgeous s  orange  peach smell with slight dank earthy notes  t  it has that burst of juicy fruit goodness on the tongue  as if you were to bite into a pineapple or peach  it s almost acidic initially  like sharp juice bomb  it s followed by a balanced bitter finish  bit piny and like rinds from fruits f  it s silky smooth  medium full mouth feel for an ipa  reminds me of central water cassian sunset mouth feel  silky  overall  it s just a great juice bomb  glad to have tried my first th beer       phenomenal cloudy  hazy  liquid  smell of pineapple  peach  and mango  tropical  creamy smooth feel  overall superb brew      just an awesome  awesome  juicy  hoppy beer             s  apricots  peaches  mango  pineapple  grapefruit  orange juice  grass  earthy spice  ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ t  sweet oranges  grapefruit  peach  apricots  papaya  pine  spice  bready malt  earthy  ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ m  similar mouthfeel and purée ish body as seen with green  but with a lot more gusto  sticky  tongue tickling carbonation  slight booze burn  ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ o  an outstanding brew by its merits  but my weak little asian stomach can t seem to stomach the magnitude of this brew  i ll perhaps one day  if there ever comes a day when i have the chance to drink this more frequently  grow into this super thick super juicy super saturated haze fad  but as for now this is just too much for me to handle     appearance   pours cloudy pulpy orange color  looks like a glass of orange juice  nice white head great lacing  smell   mango  orange peel  grapefruit  pineapple and peach  the hops are coming through nicely as well  taste   very juicy topical ipa sweet and very nice hop flavor  the best way i can describe this is someone added fresh hops to freshly squeezed juice  amazing flavors and very well balanced  plenty of orange and pineapple as well as mango papaya and grapefruit  this is dangerously drinkable and no sign of the    abv  feel   medium body very smooth  although it is medium body it still has very full and creamy feel  overall   this is an amazing brew  it hits all the notes from the tropical smell and taste to the well balanced hoppiness and smooth feel    split a growler  it pours cloudy yellow gold color that has the classic new england ipa looks  head was foamy  off white and about  finger thick  fading slowly and leaving minimal spotty lacing  smells of fresh citrus hops  pineapple  grapefruit  orange peel  lemon zest  mango  dank piney hops  luscious tropical fruit  graham cracker  biscuit  toasted grains and a general lovely fruity sweetness  all hops but just enough malt backbone to make it almost perfectly balanced  tastes pretty much like it smells but with added citrus fruit like papaya  star fruit  grapes and pear  bitterness is mild and the abv is completely hidden  making this incredibly easy to drink  delicious  another home run by tree house     l  very orange in color with a white frothy head that stays around for a while  s  orange with a little peach and other citrus  t  similar to the nose  though not quite as juicy as the smell and a little less sweetness than some of the other th beers  you can t really taste the bitterness  and this hides an   abv better than any beer i ve ever had this strong  delicious  f  some carbonation  not as hefty as some other ne ipas  but nice  o  great beer  up there with all their others  the slight decrease in sweetness was actually a positive for my palate the night i drank it         overall excellent beer  a bit more malty than other treehouse ipas  tropical smell and flavors  light carbonation and slight fading bitterness  i d get this one again              bought a  ml growler on thursday    appearance includes a very murky yellow orange with a thick  bubbly head with thick lacing on the sides  aromas are very apparent with grapefruit  tangerine  and orangepeel smells  taste follows the nose with an incredibly fruity  citrus mostly  flavor  including a sharp orange aftertaste  the mouthfeel really helps to bring out the flavors by making this beer have a medium carbonation while being very refreshing  overall  this was a fantastic beer  especially with its aromas          hazy  to be expected   taste is super mango  super fruity  with a bitter  wet finish  i can taste the alcohol very slightly  flavor spreads nicely  good drinking beer       poured from growler  days after buying  dark orange murky look  big juicy notes of mango and melon passionfruit  i found finish to be pretty bitter  enjoyed this but little underwhelmed     very nice double ipa  nice aroma out of the glass with the same hazy appearance as most every other treehouse beer that i have had  great fruit and tropical flavors on the palette as well     my st treehouse brew i was able to trade for  canned    poured into teku glass  milkshake haze orange appearance brings an insane aroma of pineapple  mango orange when i popped open the can  taste is mango  orange hoppy goodness with a very boozy finish i was not expecting  but enjoyed   overall very crushable the alcohol burn on the finish is what pushed this to almost a  for me most juice bombs i have had are a little too sweet  will definitely be seeking out a lot more th in the future    canned date of    appearance   pours extremely hazy and orange in color with an off white  frothy finger width head  fair retention  resulting in a thin  consistent layer of suds across the surface  fair lacing  most of which is made up of spotting found around the glass  smell   plenty of juiciness on the nose  with orange  pineapple  lesser peach and a hint of spice  taste   follows the nose  juicy notes of orange and pineapple upfront  following shortly with lesser notes of peach and mango  a touch of hop spice and some stonefruit pit nuttiness mid taste  the back end rings with fair grapefruit pith and some light  bready sweetness  mouthfeel   medium bodied with moderate carbonation  smooth drinker  though a touch of chalkiness  presumably from the yeast  in the texture  overall   one heck of a ne style dipa  and certainly one of the trendsetters of the style  if there s one knock  it may be a bit too yeasty  but i m nitpicking  this is a damn tasty brew          pours a hazy  obviously  golden yellow color with a frothy bone white head  the smell hits your nose right as you open the can  notes of mango  pineapple  guava  grapefruit  and orange  also getting a slightly weedy aroma as well  taste is majorly up front with pineapple  mango  and guava  with bitter grapefruit and orange zest coming through towards the end  alcohol is slightly noticeable  mouthfeel is smooth and creamy  carbonation is slightly low but helps with the overall mouthfeel  overall  an amazing ne dipa  it has that typical tropical taste and smooth feel you d expect from breweries like tree house  trillium  and monkish     excellent selection if you re looking to try treehouse beers and can t get your hands on julius or green  tastes great    big thanks to kegatron for the growler share  poured into a snifter appears a milky looking melted creamsicle orange color with a white head that holds well painting the glass with a curtain of lace  aroma is fruity orange pineapple juice very hoppy and wonderful smelling  slight grassiness and overall hop pellet feel with a touch of alcohol  as it breathes even more tropical hop scents emerge  taste is more of the same orange juice meets pineapple  mango  cantaloupe  honeydew with slight yeastiness and bitter lingering grassy pith pulp  medium in body with modest carbonation  this has a creamy yeast filled feel that goes down easy  despite tasting similar to just about every other hoppy thing ive had from tree house  this one brings a little brighter pop of fruity quality  hell yea id drink it again if offered  this goes down crazy easy  never would have guessed it at               an amazing ipa unlike many i have had   a unique flavor with note of papaya  the nose and mouth on this beer is so pleasant and different                 from the oz can  dated     served in an imperial pint nonic  pours a profoundly turbid orange grapefruit colour with a generous finger of lush  creamy head  retention is just pretty good but leaves a rich  enduring skim of suds and thick sheets of lacing  from a classical standpoint  this beer is butt ugly  to the aficionado of neiipa s  it is a beverage of surpassing beauty  the nose is sugar cookies  peaches  pineapples  and sweaty sex in a weedy ditch  tastes of soft  juicy  fruity yeast  dank herbal notes  fresh white bread  pineapple  grapefruit pith  orange zest and a melange of various fermented  read boozy  tropical fruits  ends with grass clippings and a little pine tingle  the feel is oily and medium heavy  very juicy but well carbonated  all  maybe just almost all   of the tree house pa s share that signature  instantly identifiable peachy bubblegum yeasty somethingness and haze is no exception  the booze is quite prominent on this one  maybe a little too much so but  otherwise  it s just so damn good that it s hard to ding it too much for that      l  cloudy  milky orange yellow  coul d almost pass for mango juice  two to three fingers of head  left a thick lacing all the way down the glass  s  pineapple juice  t  follows nose with some mango  papaya  orange peel  slighty bitter on the end  as it warms a pine bitterness finishes  f  sticky  moderate to high carbonation  medium body  o  well done new england dipa  alcohol is well hidden  very juicy    another winner from treehouse  tasty n juicy like everything i ve had from them  very easy to drink and smooth  like pretty much everyone who s had th brews i just wish you could get more           look  opaque hazy orange with a white head  smell  pungent fruit hops burst from the can  notes of peach  pineapple  papaya  guava  and grapefruit dominate the nose  all hops  taste  thick juicy hops buckle the tongue with notes of peach  pineapple  grapefruit pith  papaya  and guava  this slowly fades to a honey biscuit malt with a lingering bitter pine as it finishes  feel  thick and juicy yet not abrasive  light bitter on the finish and just a hint of alcohol on the finish  very drinkable for the abv  overall  one intense iipa  big  juicy  and tongue buckling  yet drinks way below its actual abv  the flavors develop over the course of the sip adding an unexpected complexity that just adds to the beauty of this beer  it s not just juice it has a notable malt and layers to the hops  world class stuff                      wow  this beer starts off with and amazing pour  both in its coloration and it s beautiful head  hazy  almost pastel orange colour  appears practically radioactive  screaming juicy and it doesn t disappoint  strong blood orange aroma  taste is well balanced  oranges with a bit of peach  not too sweet or acidic  soft mouth feel with considerable body  a real thrill to drink this    can dated     pours hazy pale yellow  closely resembles grapefruit juice with a one inch off white head that remains as a cap on top and leaves strands of lace on the drink down  the smell is of fresh squeezed citrus juicy with some faint tropical fruit accents  the taste follows with juicy grapefruit and a hint of pine bitterness  full texture  world class    of the half dozen or so tree house offerings that i have had  i still think that this is my overall favorite  it looks beautiful in the glass  as do most all of their beers   appears as a hazy  golden pineapple with a bit of white head that leaves a very nice lacing as the beer goes down  nose consists of tropical fruit and citrus along with notes of peach  taste is similar but mixed with a touch of dank hops  that note of peach comes through in the taste as well and there are hints of pepper towards that finished that make me assume there s some amarillo hops to this one  which is likely why i m such a fan of this beer  feel is as expected   smooth and slightly creamy  overall  this is an excellent beer that i wish i could get consistently and imo  the best of their  regular  offerings       oz  can   days old a  cloudy orange juice looking with a fluffy white one finger head  sticky lacing left after every sip  s  apricot  peach  mango  pineapple  throw in all the tropical fruits you can think of  slightly resinous  t  another fruit juice in beer form from tree house  mango  papaya  peach    you get the picture  perfect amount of bitterness  slight alcohol warming  great stuff  m  medium to full and smooth  perfect amount of carbonation  silky  o  like all the tree house ipa s i have tried  i love it  recommended if you can get it     look  cloudy  golden orange with a thick creamy looking head smell  citrus  floral  mango  orange  caramel  grapefruit taste  hop bitterness up front  fading to a floral finish with orange feel  very oily  almost slick from the hop oils truly a juicy  juicy double ipa      from the  oz  can dated aug     sampled the same day on aug     the pour is a hazy looking yellow color under a modest white foamy head  lingering head  the aroma brings out orange  tangerine  peach  and citrus character mainly but there is still a worthwhile toasted bread and biscuit character worth mentioning  zero booze for     medium to full body but so smooth  the peach jumps forward in the taste but is usurped by the other fruity character and toasted bread sweetness that hovers under it all  mostly clean finish  just delightful and worth waiting in line to grab one         look   hazy  as the same says  little bit dark but pretty similar compared to julius  aroma   this aroma is fucking crazy  pure peach bomb from yeast  then tropical fruits from hops  mouthfeel   medium medium  flavor   this is my second dipa from th so its hard to tell  but they are all  boozy  and i dont like that  trillium perfectly hides the alcohol taste  but this has a sharp alcohol taste at the start  other tastes are great thi  overall   the booziness ruins everything  wish they make a regular version of this  sad                   another great beer from treehouse  similar to the julius   very similar to me  exotic flavors shine through   notes of fruit  mango  orange  rine   seems to be a staple with treehouse  tastes extremely similar to the julius   smooth  refreshing  definite dankness to this one  hops shine through  but the fruit definitely is at the front of the flavors  the fruit blends in and is in balance with the malt backbone   it all works   beautifully  all in all a great beer   didn t change my life  but was an amazing offering from treehouse  can t wait to have more of these and continue trying some different beers from treehouse             canned    consumed    a  pours out a bright golden orange  sits completely opaquely in the glass  a murky and turbid yet still vibrant heavily burnt orange  s  tons of orange  spritzy oj mixed with pithy  astringent orange pith  tropical and stone fruit undertones—peach  passionfruit  mango  bit of grassy dankness as well  significant backing of sweet white bready malt  t  sweet  delectable citrus juice up front  orange with tons of lemon and lime throughout  explodes off the tongue initially  but succumbs relatively quickly to a milder assortment of tropical fruits—papaya  peach  passionfruit  an herbaceous and bitter finish combats any noticeable sweetness from the malts  imparting a well balanced and almost cocoa powder esque quality to the finish  m  rich and luscious  very reminiscent of the feel on green  bubblegum yeastiness hints at a milkshake esque feel  a bit more bitter—though more floral than piney or astringent—on the finish  but a welcome bitterness in its balance of the sweet  doughy malt that sits further in the foreground on haze than it does in other th brews  it s not quite as thick and full as green  but it s pretty close  o  up there with anything else i’ve tried from tree house  haze pops in both the flavor and aroma categories  packing a punch of orange juiciness that is pretty much unrivaled in its intensity  i’ve heard haze aptly described as a fusion of some of the defining characteristics of julius and green  and i totally see this  it embodies an amped up version of julius’ orange qualities while mirroring the mid mouth doughy bubblegum flavor and herbaceous bitter finish of green  it’s really hard to find anything wrong with this beer  and i’d gladly drink it over pretty much anything else i’ve ever had  damn near perfect        oz  can dated     poured into  oz  belgian ale glass  l  f  typical treehouse head with long retention  lacing  cap  and ring  beer is hazy orange juice color  don t leave it around your kids    s  it smells wonderful from  feet away  closer in  you get orange  grapefruit  pineapple  and peach  there s also an earthiness on the back end that seems to be part of all treehouse beers  something in the water in monson   t  just a juicebomb  orange  grapefruit  pineapple  peach  lime up front with a dank earthy finish  this is really very nice  i do get a tiny bit of alcohol heat on the finish  f  medium body  light to medium carbonation  good drying on palate  very solid construction and balance  o  would be really hard for me to choose between this and julius if i had to  i tend to go with the dipas over the ipas when pressed  but both are so good  it s no wonder they blazed through  customers the day i got these cans             like many tree house beers  its somewhere between yellow and orange and  hazy  as hell  there is always this slightly creamy head as well  beautiful  aroma  enormous tropical fruit flavors  pineapple  papaya  mango  all kinds of citrus there as well  taste  this one certainly has some bite to it  grapefruit  papaya  citrus  even some faint peach  feel  medium with some chew to it    l currently drinking from the gorgeous can s  cracked the ta nb a m d enjoyed a summer reminder of why this is my favourite season t i am currently nursing my last sips of so far my favorite th brew  a s much as i enjoyed julius sap green and very green  i just am amazed by the light finish  ken will be lucky to get what i owe him o as i have had lawson s sos both canned and luckily on tap i can t call this m y favorite but definitely top        i think haze has overtaken julius as my favorite from the  regular offerings   it just has everything  look is like any other ipa from th  the smell and taste is tropical fruits but has an explosion of pineapple and grapefruit half way through swallowing it  the slight dankness and bitterness at the end makes this beer so refreshing  feel is easily my favorite from th as it coats slightly better than the other   julius  green  and alter   overall  my favorite regular offering nowadays but julius is a close second  a must trade for imo                             l poured from one day old tree house growler  pours hazy opaque  screams dank by sight s dank  hop  floral all rolled into one  why can t yankee candle make this scent  t mirrors smell  floral notes pepper the palate and leaves a smooth grapefruit finish with zero aftertaste  f hits like a double  heavy at first but smooth finish gives amnesia about heavy beginning  o simply put a winner  worth the   hour wait at brewery for growler  drink this beer you will not regret it    picked this up at the brewery on wednesday when it was breweries  poured into a tree house teku  pours a hazy orange semi cloudy brew  not as thick looking as some of their other beers  thick lacing that hangs on the glass  smells like citrus and hops  peach  passion fruit  all the things they are known for but with a little more bite from the double  taste is amazing  it follows the nose with fruit  citrus and a nice touch of hops  mouth feel is smooth  love the way it hangs on the tongue  overall  another great offering  love tree house  it s not hype and ne style juice ipas are awesome  glad i went there and stood in the line to get it           one of my favorite dipas  all the signatures of a tree house brew  super fruit and juice bomb that hides the abv very well   looks great  orange and hazy nice mellow ipa nose goes down very easy the wait was worth it      purple can shared by someone tonight  thanks  hazy murky pour with a minimal head  huge tropical fruity earthy pine and resinous hop  not much in the way of bitterness but it does linger in the finish  sweet bready malt is moderate  tasty but ugly beer     a citrus bomb  but not overly citrusy  there is some background bitterness  it has some backbone and complexity  creamy and smooth  tree house has perfected this  pillowy  mouthfeel   this is one to sip and enjoy as the flavors become more complex as it warms and opens  one word  yum    dank boozy but refreshing    traded for this beer a little while back and wanted to have a full can of this after taking a sip of this in the other half line  can dated    ha   with  alright x   written below it as this still tasted fresh when i finally gave it a go today  no floaties as the haze was still present but not overpowering  indicating that there wasn t any massive sediment in this  even though the julius was more popular and the first beer that i had from tree house  i liked this more as it wasn t as potent and was much more balanced  making it easier to sip without being hit over the head by juice and hops  lovely pour to this as the beer had the aforementioned hazy shine to it  with a muted golden hue  massive head  and tons of soapy lacing left on my pint glass  mostly orange on the nose  to go along with the yeast  some booze  and candied tangerine sweetness  all of those were in the taste  which had to be one of the most appealing and pleasing that i ve ever had in a beer  the spice from the grapefruit kicked in pretty quickly  followed by a good piney mouthfeel  dank weed  a bit of garlic  and lots of tropical fruits  slick  moderate in carbonation  and wonderfully balance  the earthy hops were a nice base to the wide range of flavors on top that meshed wonderfully together  plenty of booze here but with so much to enjoy here  who s to notice  there was just the right amount of juice and sweetness here and i didn t need a glass of water to chase this down with  beers like this come around once in a blue moon and i can t wait to get my hands on this again  with everything in near perfect proportion  what s not to love               east coast juice bomb  extra hoppy with a pop      opaque maize with a thick foam head and clingy lace  haze has an intense and powerful aroma  nicely dank  the  purple haze  connotation is spot the fuck on  sticky  spicy  herbal  cannabic aromas are complemented and maybe even toned down a touch by a cedar forest  sticky juicy peach  and pineapple upside down cake  herbal  spicy young pine and copious amounts of sweet orange and young  fresh nectarine  almost white peach  are lightly backed by earthy flavors like peanut brittle or caramel corn  biscuit  tangy  tingly and crisp  this is not the heavy ipa that it looks like  very drinkable indeed    i love green  the flavor of haze is nice  but lacks the wow factor of green  haze is a smooth delicious ale and i thoroughly enjoyed drinking it   amazing  nothing else to say             love this beer  classic tree house beer  perfect amout of orange smell  has a fruit hop taste that i love  very hazy was still the best  but another great ipa from tree house      pours haze y  oj with a white head  mouthfeel is the almost reminiscent of a stout how smooth it is  crisp citrus hops at first sip with a bread malt backbone and  finish is unbelievably smooth and creamy  drink this and a west coast bitter ipa and you wont think they are the same style  textbook east coast juice hazy ipa  just as good as julius imo          first time to th and got this  thank you god for putting me there when they release this nectar                    beautiful  murky  orange with a finger and a half of bright white head grapefruit  peppery spice  some bitter pine i don t get as much tropical fruit as most reviewers    much more pine and grapefruit on my palate  surprisingly dank  which i don t find often in new england style ipa s creamy  smooth  with a linger bitterness on the tip of the tongue  mild carbonation                         this beer lives up to its name  looks like orange juice  white head  lots of tropical flavors  juicy and clean  no bitterness  orange  papaya  and peach  medium bodied  easy drinking  a very well done beer  easy drinking for the abv  awesome              classic tree house brewing  great body  robust aromatics  mild sweetness on the end  overall a delicious beer  hugely flavorful without being overwhelming  very little bittering hops    not my style of ipa      can date     big but not overpowering  very crisp and drinkable for the abv and smooth as hell  very creamy feel with a clean finish  great brew     poured at °f from a pint can  canned on apr  into a spiegelau ipa glass  consumed on may  look  three fingers to a finger within  minutes  dull yellow in color with an extreme amount of cloudiness  plethora of small rising bubbles  lacing is subtle and very thick  smell  huge aromas of mango  papaya  peach  guava  and apricot commingle with strong aromas of spicy hops  orange  grapefruit  and tangerine along with mild white bread  earthy yeast  and piney hop aromas  taste  very strong flavors of mango  papaya  guava  peach  and apricot first burst on to the palate  the taste is amplified as strong piney hop  spicy hop  orange  grapefruit  and tangerine flavors immediately follow  balance is finally achieved as mild white bread and earthy yeast along with subtle bitter hop flavors finish off the taste theatrical as all previous flavors press on  feel  somewhere between full bodied and medium bodied  carbonation is mild  goes down smooth and somewhat creamy  finishes with a strong and unpleasant dryness  note  most people who have traversed the craft universe know that tree house does no wrong  with this being my third offering from them  i can agree  with certainty   to that statement  i have yet to try any of their bigger brews  but i greatly look forward to those one day     pours hazy  orange yellow in color  with one inch head  look exemplifies the new england hazy ipa style  taste is orange  tangerine  peach  and dank wet hops  the orange really jumps as the beer warms  super light bodied for the style  no beer with this high an abv has the right to be this smooth  of the ten or so tree house brews i have had and it may be the best ipa i have ever had  just an amazing beer              very very good       peach color with a nice white head and tons of lace  notes of peach  mango  nectarine  light strawberry  pound cake and tropical fruit  medium feel  crisp  clean and slightly dry  amazing dipa that ranks with the best of them        wowza         just days from canning  this poured light orange juice color   cloudy and murky almost looked like pulp orange juice  smell was citrus dankness with tropical fruit  taste is perfect ripe citrus fruit of tangerine mandarin  grapefruit orange with tropical dankness of papaya and mango  a great mouth feel with a non bitter hop assault   albsoluty delicious with no sign of abv   this is as good a ipa that you will ever find       with the balance of pale ale but with the complexity  intensity and strength of imperial ale  tree house brewers push the limits on hop aroma and flavor while keeping the bitter to sweet ratio a little closer to even keel  once again  the new england style ipa rears its ugly head with the murk of a mud puddle and looks like the tarnish gold of vegemite  a plethora of citrus  tropical and orchard fruits churn from the dense ecru froth and entice the nose with promises of fruit  tartness and bittersweetness  honey  caramel and crusty key lime pie come to mind as the ale creeps onto the tongue  its bright fruit bouquet transitions to taste immediately with red grapefruit  tangerine  nectarine  pineapple  mango  passionfruit  lime  lemon and kiwi  canteloupe and a berry like tang rounds out the fruitiness of the esters and hops while the persestent sweetness within coats the middle palate with layers of fructose  angel food cake and succulent honey  as the ale turns to take a bitter stride  the taste of fresh shavings of pine and sassafras weave in to command the sweetness with a fresh grassiness  herbal dankness and a curious taste of cannabis  medium full in body  the beer s imperial heft keeps the ale richer and fuller  and resists any convincing turn to dryness  bitterness or elevated crispness  what the palate gets in return is the full malt balance that gives the hops a more rounded and more complex flavor  an aftertow of herb and citrus have a warm alcohol spice counterpart in a long cream sickle finish         outstanding citrus nose  deep orange pour from the can as hazy as the name implies  similar to sip of sunshine but a bit more dank   straight pour from a oz can to an oversized wineglass  th stemware  for those curious   there’s a canning date of may    printed in black ink on the underside of the can  which reads “keep cold    suhh dude”—which would make this five days old at the time of consumption  this was purchased at the brewery on the th  and it immediately went into the fridge so these are essentially ideal tasting circumstances  appearance      two very full fingers of creamy  custard colored foam rise happily off of the pour  capping a cloudy  orange and honey colored body  the head dies down relatively slowly  leaving scattered suds near the peak of the head  a half finger collar  and a diminutive clump of foam near the center  as the body goes down  it leaves a solid sheath of foam on the far side of the glass  with peaks and valleys in its profile  smell      positively pungent  nectar like citrus dominates the nose  musky papaya flesh  sticky mango juice  and passion fruit  it blends smoothly with sugar cookie like sweetness  country bread  and earthy tones paired with a slightly grassy aroma  a dank  weedy note brings up the rear  as it warms  it shifts more toward passion fruit and sauvignon blanc like gooseberry notes  as well as a much stronger musk  this is seriously excellent stuff  taste      this shit is bonkers  i’m not entirely sure what’s going on here  honestly—it starts off with a combination of papaya muskiness and a kind of earthy  bready component  a little bit of guava and strawberry come out  followed by passion fruit  a limeade mix of citric tartness and light  balancing sweetness  and pink grapefruit flesh with sugar sprinkled on top  a grassy note mixes in at this point  making for a slightly cannabis like feel  all throughout  a layer of sugar cookie sweetness tempers any bitterness  helping to accentuate the fruitiness of it all  amazingly  there’s no noticeable booziness in the flavor  thought a slight spiciness does come up in the finish  mouthfeel      smooth  slick  and somewhat on the full  side of medium weight  with a juicy  nectar like feel  still  the oily hop presence dries out the feel significantly just as the beer finishes  all throughout  the carbonation is fine grained  subtle  and smooth  matching the body’s thickness with its creamy feel  the alcohol appears here just a bit  with a boozy dryness that blends in with the hop bitterness  smooth and satisfying  with a feel that matches its heft and hop load  overall      this is  in the end  an outstanding  smooth  supremely fruity  satisfying dipa  this is  effectively  new england style hop juice  and there’s not an unpleasant thing about it  but it does lack some of the depth and complexity of my very favorite dipas  not that i am complaining for even a second—just explaining what might separate this from the most world class of world class dipas  this is still  in every single way  an absolute joy to drink  i’m guessing it goes without saying       but this is highly recommended      had from  day old growler obtained at th brewery one of my all time favorite beers tree house brews  pours a hazy orange like most tree house ipa s are know for but not as thick in appearance as say their julius is  as other reviewers have said it drinks like a beer with a much lower abv      tons of lacing and the ever present aroma of orange  mango and peach  just and amazing all around beer      cloudy hazy orange color as the name suggests   the brewery is known for  head disappears quick   leaves a sticky resiny lacing  smell is tropical fruit  orange   grapefruit  taste is bitter but citrusy  just like other th beers  the bitterness lingers  it s tingly   sharp  as i drink i notice there s a lot of settling happening with a lot dropping out to bottom of glass  i think this is fine but overrated      poured into a snifter from a can dated    alright x    perfect  dank hop aroma and less hazy than julius or green  oh so fruity  perfect ipa taste  shared from a dld trade           haze is an exceptional dipa for a few reasons one it drinks like a much lighter beer  the fruit aromas are a bouquet of tropical fruit  the mouthful is substantial  i love purple and haze        hazy  hoppy goodness  not a big fan of hops  in general  but th beers have made me learn how to deal with them for their delicious hoppy beers  certainly not out of this world  but a damn solid beer     thanks so much to tenderbranson for sharing this  from the can in a tulip chilled  i had taken a long walk and this slaked my thirst in just the right way  the color is like fresh pressed juice with white head and fine bead with lots of lace clinging in rings with good retention  the smell is so juicy you might believe there is actual fruit in this   very tropical  the smell has a citrus quality with lemony and lightly grassy zesty smell that brings out herbal and subtle stone fruit accents  the feel is great   fruity and tangy with medium carbonation and semi sweet entry yet juicy tangy and bitter balances out with a semi dry yet very light astringent aspect with a long hop finish  the taste is as great as the smell hints at just a lovely mix of sweet citrus and tropical fruit flavors in the hops with a very mild malt to supplement that juicy taste and soft bitter accent with a more herbal sweetgrass taste in the back with malt and bitterness more balanced in order that there is no alcohol in the taste  overall i found this to be smooth  drinkable fresh and lively as far as the intensity of the hop flavor and it is very quaffable for a    beer i was able to sip and enjoy this very easily looking forward to future tastes of this fine brew    this beer is good but certainly not in my top  for dipas  it looks hazy as expected with a nice orange hue  it has good citrus smells and flavor with a slightly dank bitter aftertaste which again is good but not great  there are so many breweries that aren t hyped up nearly as much as th that do it better  for example cellarmaker   other than julius  which is an excellent yet one dimensional juice bomb  i don t see why everyone is going so ape shit over this brewery      poured into snifter  wonderful look of cloudy pineapple juice  nose is fresh mango  pineapple maybe slight orange  mouthfeel is excellent just like all treehouse where your entire mouth is coated by hop particles  flavor profile seems to be fresh pineapple and citrus followed by some juicy grapefruit and rounding out with some nice sweetness  this beer is overall outstanding like all treehouse  im not sure if this is better or worse than julius  alter   green  etc  they are all really outstanding  it just depends on what hops your palate likes best  edit  did side by side with very hazy and very similar  very had little more nose and more bitterness  slightly more flavor throughout  little darker in color    serving  can canned  mar    consumed apr   thanks  kc  pours a cloudy pale gold with a big  billowing white foam cap that sticks around very well  big globs and rings of lacing  the aroma is a mix of juicy melon  orange  mango  pungent green hops and a biscuity malt backbone  the flavor is right on the smell s heels but a lot oilier and stankier as far as the hops are concerned  orange pith  grapefruit  soft mango flavors  melon and a final wave of dank  resinous hop cone oiliness  medium body  active carbonation  fairly drinkable with a lingering sappy sweaty finish  this is a very good beer that i throughly enjoyed  it has a little something that sets it aside from other ipas from th as well as other beers that i have had  i could just describe it as sweaty  both in taste and smell is is fruity  it is juicy  it is resinous  but there is a lingering undercurrent of a pungent  almost sharp tang of funky dank hop stank  it is good  but it is also the one thing that keeps it from being more drinkable for me  especially since it is tied to the bitter oily finish  fabulous beer  i would definitely have it again     this beer pours an opaque cloudy burnt orange with a golden hue when held up to the light  the head is dense   fingers and bright white  retention is excellent and there are intricate patterns of webbed lacing all over the glass  smell is orange  grapefruit  pineapple and dankness  absolutely incredible  taste is the same with a bit of bitterness on the finish  feel is light side of medium  soft and juicy with a sticky finish  overall this beer is absolutely immaculate  the best double ipa i ve ever had by a pretty wide margin                   canned     can saying   alright x    i can dig the matthew mcconaughey reference  appearance   living up to its name  haze is    hazy  this is pretty much the de facto description of the appearance for all tree house ipas so far  it seems to be a little lighter in appearance than either julius or sap  the head is very foamy and long lasting  aroma   the nose brimming with juicy notes from the fresh hops and the peach aroma is through the roof  a pulpy orange note follows next like a glass of freshly squeezed o j  and just the faintest hint of pine at the end  taste   finally  a tree house beer that tastes as good as it smells  the hops are obviously the most dominant flavor here  but it is all juicy goodness  there is almost no bitterness at all despite the high alcohol and hop dosage  again  i m getting tons of peach  orange  pine sap  and other tropical fruits that it s pretty crazy actually  perhaps a tiny bit of malt backbone as well  but who needs it when the hops carry the flavor as well as this does  mouthfeel   the mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation  tree house nails the body perfectly once again  with a soft texture that accentuates the hops  this is probably the lightest dipa i ve had  closing arguments   overall  this is far and away the best tree house beer i ve had so far that i could actually sit down with and analyze  lights on may give it a run for its money  but that was at a tasting  so different circumstances there  whereas julius and sap didn t live up to their billing  haze carries the standard and doesn t relinquish it in the flavor  if i had this blind  there s no way i d peg it as anywhere close to    dangerously crushable for sure    l   hazy   as advertised  good lacing on the glass  lighter towards the top and grows deeper in the snifter  s  wonderful  papaya  mango  tropical  very very strong nose  t   the beer does not sip as strong fruity forward as the smell as the bite at the end is bitter and lingers  lots of resiny earthy pine in the finish that lingers long  almost so much so that it overpowers everything else though the more you drink it the more the other notes come off the sidelines and take hold  f   does not feel like   at all  light  fluffy  very good here  o   this is my first crack at tree house and it is very very good  almost a jeckyl and hyde type situation where the smell is so citrus and the finish is so earthy dank but they pull it together nicely  the more you sip it the more you get from it too  great stuff                oz tallboy can poured into a snifter glass  l   true to the name  haze pours a very hazy  almost opaque orange  with a thin film of pearl white head that dissipates and leaves some streaking on the glass and surface  the color and opacity resembles freshly squeezed orange juice  in a way  s   there s a distinct sweetness on the first whiff that reminds me of nectarines and peaches  followed by more subtle notes of papaya and a hint of orange  the sharper citrus notes that are typical of hop bombs are missing  and in its place is a slight touch of honey  as expected  there s a pretty strong earthy dankness backing up all of scents  making for an overall smell that s more warm and comforting than tropical and refreshing like most ipas  different  but still very nice  t   the tropical papaya notes come through pretty clearly on the first sip  which is followed by a slight maltiness  not the most refreshing or juicy of ipas  but definitely still very enjoyable  finished with a strong dash of hop resin  which comes across slightly more bitter than crisp  it has all the right components of a great dipa  but somehow  it s not making a huge impression on me  admittedly  this might be because i ve been drinking some fantastically fresh ipas lately  other half stacks on stacks  grimm tesseract  heady topper  etc    f   mouthfeel is pretty consistent with all the other characteristics  moderately fine carbonation brings a spritz that complements the hoppiness  and a slight viscosity of the liquid itself goes along with the smell and look  o   i can t exactly say i m disappointed by haze  since it s still a very good double ipa  definitely not as impressive as the other tree house ipa i ve had so far though  bright   and some of its contemporary dipas that i mentioned earlier  i would get this again  but there are other beers that i ve had before that i d be more keen on acquiring more of       my favorite tree house beer  haziness in the best possible ways           this is quite possibly the most vile  putrid  and over hyped beer i have ever consumed  it smells of a sun baked  two week overdue litter box and tastes like a combination of mango  papaya  and guava juice mixed with alley cat urine  i suspect the carefully selected hop mixture has a neurotoxic effect on the brain that forces formerly astute beer drinkers to stand in line for hours awaiting their great depression era rations of this sludge  chemical engineering and marketing genius  looks like beer  feel is tough to judge because it is forcefully ejected from my mouth before i have much time to ponder the oral sensation of this prized brew  three cans sampled over eight months    not my favorite offering from th  but still really good   just insane  this is      amazing depth of flavor  from bitter to sweet to fruit to grass and even a hint of spice  balanced with just a hit of the booze here  crafted  not just a haze bomb  hop bomb  juice bomb or fruit bomb    all of the above    tasting my fourth tree house ipa ever  only other ones i ve had are green  alter ego  julius  and this one  so i ll go head and make a few comparisons  pour is a beautiful murky  cloud orange  seems to be a little more straw yellow than the other offerings i ve had  nice tight white bubbles head  great lacing on the glass  smell seems to be the medium in the most hoppy  resinous th i ve had  julius   and the fruitier tropical green  soon as you crack the can  you get whiffs of peach  orange  tangerines and papaya  then again you still get that slight resinous smell in the back end  reminiscent of marijuana and sweet malt  besides the tropical fruit and hop resin i m getting some nice honey as well  taste is an interesting blend of all the smells i got in the nose  tropical goodness like peaches  papaya and tangerines  but the most unique about haze is its honey sweet nectar quality  definitely has a subtle sweet floral taste to it  hop profile definitely isn t dominant  sweet malt profile as well  mouthfeel doesn t come as a surprise  not as much as a fruit dole feel like green  but a more organic orange juice feel  overall  quite possibly my favorite th i ve had so far  not as much of a fruity bomb as green  not as much hop profile as julius  kind of the medium  like alter ego  but with a more honey nectar flavor  lovely beer    from oz can packaged  days ago  enjoyed in a swell tulip glass after coaching a bu evening soccer practice  this beer is a terrific value  as craft beer prices continue to creep up and up  you want to drink this one  l  pours a perfect cloudy orange hazey look     head at pouring  dissipates to fine lacing after a minute  looks great  had it a few times over the past  months and after a while it becomes almost hoh hum  another beautiful glass of haze  very killah  repeat ability in batches is very important to me and it is demonstrated by the th team s  very juicy  love it  slight hoppy after the fruity t  wicked killah stuff here  great citrusy  piney with hop but not too big a hop hit  overall great flavor f  love it in my mouth  very fill all over flavors  very good length  taste it well after swallowing it  slight bitter ending not bitey  really nice o  well  it s wicked pissah and i love it  so easy to drink  at just over half the cost of trillium mettle  which i like a lot   this is not only a really great beer but a great value            another perfect beer by tree house  can t wait until they build their new facility   can shared by curran last night  thanks man  this one pours a hazy  duh  and turbid honey orange color  with a half inch head  and a little bit of lacing  smells fantastically hoppy and fruity  with lots of orange  and grapefruit  mango  and pineapple  with some dankness and pine and that sort of thing  this is probably the best tree house beer that i ve had  it balances pretty deftly the big juicy hop character that most tree house beers have  with a nice level of dank marijuana type flavors  a hefy bitterness  but also a big juice blast  there s some grapefruit  orange  pineapple  and mango  and tons of it  this is absolutely delicious  this has a nice crisp and creamy mouthfeel  with a great level of drinkability  my favorite beer yet from tree house  a stunner     poured from a ml growler filled    into a  ounce tulip  the look is cloudy and opaque  it looks like pineapple juice but a little darker and more orange  small  white head  which dissipated quickly  leaving moderate lacing  the smell is strong oranges   almost smells like orange juice   with a hoppiness coming through underneath  the mouthfeel is very smooth with medium carbonation  the taste is strong citrus   orange  and some grapefruit   but the hop presence is much stronger than i expected from the smell  in no way is any one flavor overpowering  this beer is incredibly balanced with no hint of alcohol  overall  this beer is fantastic and very easy to drink  i completely understand the hype on the beer  and tree house  if all their ipas follow the quality of this one  every taste gives me a little hint of different flavors  i ll definitely look for more from them  given the chance           fantastic beer that i most recently had on   canned    whole depth of flavors including the papaya and peach that are advertised  grapefruit  melon  pineapple as well  very unique beer and very delicious  hazy dipa and what an amazing offering from th       to me  all of tree house s releases are world class in that they contain the signature creaminess  this element really puts them above all the rest  haze is no different  it s a nice rounded navel orange haze bomb with the aroma of grapefruit  the taste is much more tropical than most of their other releases  as stated in the description papaya comes through along with guava  dragon fruit  and some pineapple in addition to the citrus of grapefruit and orange  the feel is incredibly smooth with that chewy cream  stellar beer             look  super hazy  light yellow orange with very little translucency  creamy head with small tight bubbles retained around rim throughout the drink  smell  citrus  mango   definitely orange peel and maybe some lemon  taste  more of those citrus flavors  mostly getting orange and nectarine  feel  fairly balanced bitterness but still quite the citrus bite up front  slightly creamy but not thick  overall  it is a great dipa but the market is flooded  this exceeds others because of how well it masks the abv              nice beer  grab what you can get  good for the non super hoppy fans  enjoy   this is one of the best double ipa offerings i ve ever tasted  it has a predominantly citrus scent  tastes like grapefruit peach fresh hops  similar to other tree house ipa s  but this one boasts a higher abv which makes it a little more impressive to me  overall  an outstanding beer            this is the best beer that i have ever had     this would normally be  s across  but very hazy exists  l  incredibly turbid  murky pineapple with tons of head  s  tropical fruit juice  bubblegum  hint of dank  it s a little subtle  but most th beers are  which is different at first  but really grows on you  t  it s not technically a  as very hazy is just a hair better  but it s better than    tropical juice  pineapple  bit of dankness and greenery to balance  somewhat subtle  but it makes the beer crazy drinkable  it s hard to not chug  f  perfect  full and creamy with light carb  o  my favorite standard th beer  i enjoy it more than green as it has a robust hop dankness as opposed to green s zesty  clove like hop character  it s nearly just as good as very hazy  but that s just a hint more intense       pours a super hazy orange with a finger of white head  very reminiscent of orange juice  aroma is very tropical  lots of mango  pineapple with some grapefruit  peach  and melon  taste is much like the aroma with huge mango notes upfront  changing to pineapple  with melon in the finish  good mouthfeel  medium light body and moderate carbonation yield a pillowy mouthfeel  overall this is another great example of a new england style ipa from tree house but i just find this to be too juicy for my tastes        peach julius         hazy tangerine color  beautiful lacing mango  melon  citrus  dank sweet stone   tropical fruits upfront  pine  so freakin juicy slick mouthfeel with enjoyable bitterness definitely one of the best dipa s i have ever tasted     growler filled     enjoyed    in my th tulip  look  golden haze  this is the perfect beer      smell  swamp  fruit  hops  sweet  sweat  funk  sugar  cotton candy  bubble gum      taste  perfectly sweet  reminds me of a milkshake  hoppy  malty  perfect balance  cotton candy  bubble gum  spice  herb  weed      feel  mediocre bite at first that mellows out with sweetness  just enough alcohol  hops  malt  yeast      overall  this is my favorite offering from treehouse  a stronger dipa with a nice fruit complexity to balance out the malt and abv  it s hard to stop drinking this one  if you have the opportunity to try this one  i highly recommend it  like mbc dinner with an explosion of fruit and candy           as perfect a beer as i ve ever had  poured into a tulip  nice cloudy deep orange with a finger of foam  melon citrus smell and taste  no hint of the high ish alcohol level is tasted  usual silky treehouse feel  outstanding  this and green are my top two choices from th  i would change nothing       can oz abv     canned on      consumed     not as fresh as i d like  poured into game of thrones  ours is the fury pint glass  half inch offwhite foam head  fine bubble composition  head persists at the time of this review  as hazy as advertised  appearance akin to fresh urine from a patient with acute urinary tract infection  also resembles apple cider  aroma  grandmas peach cobbler  college buddies weed  unpasteurized tropicana  obvious prunes  figs notably absent  taste  deconstructed fig newton reduction with peach glaze  juice notes dominate the front end  gradually giving way to the dank train  feel  perfect carbonation  soft and pillowy like a tempurpedic  tm  in liquid form  overall  definitely stirs the loins  lives up to its name  on a scale of danker to wanker  i would drink this again   wankerthoughts  blessed           canned    pours a very turbid  hazy orange color with a nice finger head that leaves a ton of lacing on the glass  smells like a fresh bowl of mashed citrus fruit with a strong herbaceous note mixed in  tastes like a fresh fruit smoothie  citrus  orange rind  peach  nectarine   awesome  mouthfeel is pretty creamy for an ipa but i think green still takes the cake  a killer offering from th           amazing double ipa  the smell and taste of this beer is incredible  orange and pineapple  dark hazy color looks great in glass  exceptional mouthfeel  one of my absolute favorites    poured from a can into a teku  peach and tropical fruit in both the nose and taste  classic th mouthfeel  which sets some of their offerings apart  worth searching out             l  murky  and yes hazy dark yellow orange  a beautiful glowing orb with some light behind it  gorgeous pure white head leaving sticky lacing  s  a huge burst of spiced and hopped pineapple  orange and passion fruit  these folks need to make their own brand of candles  t  bursting citrusy hops  amazing blend of sweet fruit and dry hops  spiced orange on the finish  f  very bright with huge hoppy feel and solid presence of carbonation  o  this is my new favorite th offering  i wouldn’t change a thing and i’ll make the trip whenever this is offered       there s not much i can say about this beer that hasn t already been said  i really love this beer  it s got all the great characteristics of a tree house beer  but with a bit more attitude  the mouthfeel is absolutely perfect    fantastic  treehouse classic      canned    reviewed    straw lemon yellow and the name does not disappoint  hazy and murky  thinnish   finger white head almost like a nitro  smell slightly underwhelming  fruits pineapple and mango bomb  no malt backbone to be found yet not bitter at all other than a little grapefruit deeper into the pint  delicious  well carbonated and not cloying  edging on dry for the abv  fantastic beer  can t wait to share with others    similar vibe to julius  which i had just a day earlier  same juicy flavors on the nose  however  unlike julius where these orange and mango flavors are the star  in haze the hops take center stage and the juice is the supporting cast  same great unfiltered look and lovely mouth feel exist here as well  very nicely done    not usually a big fan of ipas or iipas because they are so often bitter more than anything else  this had plenty of lush citrus flavours  good acidity  and lush mouthfeel to balance out a surprisingly modest bitter finish  i could drink this and heady any day of the week with no complaints                        easily my favorite tree house iipa  it has the unmistakable tree house creaminess and amazing smell when you pop a fresh can  juicy  but less bitter than their other iipas  definitely tastes better after a week or two like most canned hops  imo            l   hazy light orange s   hints of peach  some tropical fruit t   some fruit  slight bitterness  delicious  f   good carbonation  thick mouthfeel o   fantastic       another superior tree house offering  a little less fruity and a little more hoppy at the end than julius or alter ego  has that cloudy honey orange color that announces that unfiltered goodness is on the way  fantastic nose   mango  citrus  touch of pine  taste says tangerine and pine to me with some softer fruits  strong hops bitterness follows  mouth feel   nice carbonation  then soft flow over the tongue  finishes with a lingering bitterness  fruit flavors emerge more as beer warms a bit  nice  appropriate carbonation  bottom line   another world class beer  for me  among the citrus style dipas and ipas  tree house is the absolute king of the mountain  now if they could only move closer to virginia                                a  pours a hazy  wait a minute    just got the name   dark golden color with a one finger fluffy cream colored head  s  citrus  pine  mango and passionfruit with a soft malt backbone  smells pretty amazing  t  super smooth and just a great mix of citrus and pine  some tangerine  mango and just a touch of honey malt  really  really really love this one  might be my favorite i ve had from tree house so far       can into tulip     all in my brain  l  light orange dark yellow   finger head of tight bubble with thick lacing  s  i get a good amount of sweet candied fruit in the onset  which segues into some nice pine notes with tropical fruits mixed in as well  touch of alcohol on the back end  t  a good amount of haze and pine  more so than on the nose  some nice sweetness on the finish  f  nice medium mouthfeel and great carbonation     oz can poured into a tulip on the same day it was canned     look  hazy and orange  but a bit darker than other tree house brews i ve had  almost looks like a non alcoholic apple cider  poured a half finger of white head that quickly fell into almost nothing  sparse lacing  smell  peach and apricot off the bat  definitely get some tangerine  guava  and mango too  noticeable pine too  not as much as green but more than julius  probably the best balance of fruit and pine characters of the th beers i ve had  dankness really cuts through as it warms  taste  just as balanced as the nose  pine and citrus working in almost perfect tandem  extraordinarily bitter aftertaste  not unpleasant  but noteworthy  in my opinion  the fruit really comes to the forefront as it sits out and warms up a bit  feel  fairly high carbonation that dances and explodes in your mouth  medium to thick mouthfeel that foams and froths  coating the mouth  the finish is clean and a little alcoholic  overall  another top tier beer from tree house  surprise surprise  it seems that these guys and gals can do no wrong  not my favorite offering thusfar  but honestly it really becomes a splitting of hairs when you re dealing with beer of this caliber  by no means would i decline the opportunity to purchase this in future visits         had this for the first time  it won t be the last  got better as i got to the bottom of the can  great feel on the mouth  you could really taste the hoppy juiciness of the this beer                          drinking side by side with a king julius  and its damn near as good    very similar  just less tropical and a tad bit more hoppy  this is of course a world class dipa  but even near the top of that group    drank from a  pint can purchased at tree house brewing company  monson  ma    served in a snifter a finger tall  frothy white crown topped the opaque  orangey amber liquid  although the beer is called  haze   the body on this could clearly be categorized as  cloudy   in fact  it looked very much like orange juice  the head quickly fell to a barely there film  drippy streaks of lacing trickled down the glass  the aroma was really hoppy and bright  tropical fruits came through strong right off the bat  loads of passionfruit  good amount of mango  peach notes were apparent as well  lots of zesty orange and orange peel  juicy and fruity  as the beer sat  the orange notes took over  later  the peach really came forth  the flavor profile was solid but more pithy and simple than the nose  intense citrus notes  orange peel dominated  really juicy and fresh  just a touch bitter  peach notes also came through strong  bit of mango  white grapefruit appeared in the finish  fairly rind like and moderately bitter  some pithiness lingered after the swallow  on the palate  the beer was medium bodied  perhaps a bit thinner than anticipated  the liquid contained a very fine  mellow effervesce that tuned the beer creamy and frothy on the palate  this almost felt a bit under carbonated  haze is a really solid  citrus forward double ipa  but it is far from tree house s most impressive hoppy offering  by most accounts  this would be an amazing shelf beer  but by tree house standards it was a bit disappointing       another fantastic ipa from tree house  i would put this citrus juiciness above alter ego  but below green and julius  still  it s just one more reason that tree house is killing it right now            appearance  the cloudy goldstraw colored liquid builds as the bubble show recedes but the resultant head is well over two fingers thick  great retention and gobs of splashy lace smell  stone fruit  peach  nectarine and apricot  mirrored by orange and tangerine citrus tones taste  peach tones emerge first  on the taste buds  but the citrus shows more power  with orange creamsicle  tangy passion fruit and papaya flavors underneath  after the swallow  a dank bitterness builds but the malt stays in the background mouthfeel  medium to full body with moderate carbonation overall  another fine example of how to brew with hops from tree house thanks  eveningcordial  for the chance to revisit              canned three days prior to tasting  hazed and murky honey colored with an orangey beige head that recedes slowly  leaving a quarter inch cap of foam  aroma of honey  florals  tangerine and mint  a mix of sweet and hoppy  muted hop flavor upfront  not very bright  mix of florals and tangerine and mint  sound familiar    some grapefruit and tangerine  semi sweet honey malt rides beneath  full but somewhat slick mouthfeel  good beer but the tree house beers are all starting to taste the same to me      pours the typical hazy tree house burnt orange color  foamy white head dissipates but a small amount lingers throughout  intricate lacing riddles the glass  smell is bursting with orange  citrus  peach  dank earth  malt  taste reflects the same with the malt hop balancing nicely with all those tropical  soft flavors  extremely smooth mouthfeel to go along with it s other th ipa counterpart  another hit from the good folks at tree house   from growler  is this beer or orange juice  moderate retention but a dollop of lingering foam  spattered lacing  millions of peaches  that s the smell i get first  a bit of earthy dank and oranges  passion fruit starburst taste  but the mild earthiness keeps it in check from total juice bomb  hint of pine  nice wet feel  mild carbonation and a bit of zest  another great beer from th         canned     appearance  pours a foamy two finger head  orange in color and incredibly hazy and dense  no visibility whatsoever  aroma  pineapple  guava  sweet grapefruit  a little spicy herbal  and a bready malt  taste  big fruity hops upfront with pineapple  orange  and citrus being most notable  middle sees some grapefruit flavor and bitterness set in  the finish is very dry with a big bready malt rounding things out  feel  very soft medium bodied  medium carbonation  and a dry finish with some oily hops lingering  overall  really enjoy the treehouse ipa s that strike a balance between juicy hops and a soft feel but with some tradtional hop flavors  grapefruit in this case  and solid bitterness  this hits both those marks  as does green  which really makes this so enjoyable  only knock is that once it warms up the hop flavor dies down a little and sweet bready doughy malt really comes out     notes  seems like the grapefruit aspect has been abandoned with this beer  with a heavier emphasis on sweet citrusy flavors  a little heavy on the sweetness  but still an excellent dipa      maybe the juiciest tree house ipa i ve had so far  i get orange  tangerine  tropical fruit  and peach with very little bitterness or malt  there is a slightly dank pine flavor but its not overpowering  the mouth feel is light and clean yet soft and fluffy  i was expecting this one to be a little bigger than the other tree house ipas and it really doesn t stand out in that way  but its very enjoyable and well worth the cost of trading         amazing iipa  if i were stranded on an island and had only one beer to take with me this would be it     poured from can apearance  looks like oj except less orange  more of a muted color smell  citrus and hops taste  pretty juicy ipa  lots of citrus  orange  mouthfeel  thought it would be a little smoother and have more of a body to it  really it just feels like any other great dipa  overall  a lot of hype around this one  and dont get me wrong it is a great dipa  but there a lot of other more accesible dipa that are on par  just maybe a little less hazy looking     a full flavor dipa with a variety of hoppy flavors  it s not the best dipa in new england  but it s close   a  pours just like the rest of the tree house ipa s  hazy as hell and bright to boot  this time  the color is a bright  light orange to almost peach or apricot in color  a smaller head forms and retains for a bit  but only laces a little bit  overall impression in the glass is that it looks a lot like a mimosa at a sunday brunch  s  the first hit on the nose is a punch of fruity and citrus hops that turns slowly toward a mild bitterness in the back half of the smell  this is really a unique smelling beer for a double ipa because it has almost no malt in the scent and also doesn t have an overpowering hop bitterness  peach  tangerine  apricot  and light orange mix in with light bitterness to provide a very enticing overall scent  t  when this beer hits the tongue  it follows somewhat of an inverted flavor arc as the scent  a mild to moderate hop bite greets the tongue first before the flavor turns more toward the citrus in the scent  the middle portion of the drink is very citrus forward  with many of the same flavors as the smell had  right at the end of the drink the hops bitterness returns and lingers with a light  but still citrus forward  bitterness  m  man  if no one told me  i might have guessed this is an apa from just the weight of the beer  it isn t light on the tongue  but it also isn t thick and heavy  the carbonation is moderate to slightly elevated  and combined with the weight of the beer  this drinks very easily  no alcohol is detectable in either taste or feel of the beer  overall  this is a very unique beer in the style category  usually i expect at least a little bit of malt in a dipa  but this one is all fruity and citrus light hop bitterness  i really enjoy this beer                     aroma is tropical heaven  gushes out of the glass with citrus galore along with intense peach  flavor follows suit with a bitterness level that teeters on the edge of scary  then brings you right back with just a touch of a bready malt backbone  this my favorite th ipa between it  julius  and green  stunning      one of the best double ipa s out there  gotta get this if you have never tried it         i rarely give a beer a perfect rating  drank this side by side with julius  green  and alter ego  this was my favorite  juicy  dank  everything you could want out of a dipa  seek it out    wow  this was an excellent beverage  hazy  orange juice like color  smell is citrus with an undertone of dankness  taste follows suit  with a nice juicy explosion with pine  as expected with an imperial  a slight alcohol presence just enough to let you know it s a double but not overpowering  i need more of this in my life    a hoppy part of a large tasting session  appearance is a cloudy  light  brown  pours two fingers of creamy head that retains very well  the look is exactly what you come to expect of tree house hoppy beers  smell is super juicy  tropical fruit notes with a solid malt backbone and a slightly floral quality  taste is just like the smell  very fruity  apples  peaches  pineapple and mangos are all there  balanced by a biscuity  malt backbone and just a touch of grassy earthiness  texture is light but very creamy with medium carbonation  very juicy  overall in terms of taste  texture  look and smell this beer delivers the quality you expect from treehouse beers  i would drink this all the time if i could                  received this as part of a trade from ba mvb  making a point to review it after having it last time and loving it so much that i didn t want to take the time to write down my notes  poured out of a tallboy that was canned on    and enjoyed just shy of a month on     poured into a pub style pint glass  appearance       pours a radiant peachy orange hue with an almost pinkish glow like you might see in some sunsets  the glow is a bi product of all the particulate in suspension  creating a roiling cloud of hop matter that is dense up near the top of the glass and wafts down in a thick  lazy wisp at the bottom of the glass  atop the liquid sits three fingers of off white foam that leaves huge sticky patches on the sides of the glass as it dissipates  smell       there is a fair amount of fruit going on here  nectarine  peach  orange zest  but the thing that really draws me in is an herbal  stinks so good pungency that rises up out of the glass  i could sit here and smell it for quite awhile before ever needing to take a swig  taste       a let down comparative to the smell  but still a wonderfully juicy brew with predominant presence of orange and peach and an herbal spiciness that again has that same dankness from the aroma influencing the taste  there is none of the heightened bitterness and sweet booziness that will sometimes turn me off of the imperial variety of ipas  but at a modest    abv  there isn t a ton of alcohol to compete with the huge hop profile  some floral nectar undertones are there as it warms up a little bit  giving some nice depth to the fruity dominance  mouthfeel       medium full bodied with moderate carbonation and a juicy  full mouthfeel from the intense quantities of hop particulate in the liquid  finish is semi sweet with just a touch of lingering bitterness  overall      yet another stellar entry from tree house  the first ipa i ve had from them that is a double  and while i personally tend to prefer single ipas due to the fact that they have relatively less booze and are more drinkable  this is one of the most drinkable double ipas i ve had the pleasure of drinking  i could drink just this and julius and have all my ipa needs filled for a long time            pours a  forgive me   hazy  yellow gold color with a medium sized white head    nice lacing  smell is that of peaches      mango  pine  and dank hops  taste follows the nose  nice balance of hops and pine  and the most peach i have ever tasted in a beer  i was so caught off guard it took me a couple sips to figure out what i was tasting  mouthfeel is that of a juicy  pretty thick for an ipa body  with a medium amount of carbonation  overall this is an excellent dipa  that incorporates flavors not commonly used in that style     near perfect ipa in my opinion  my favorite ipa today  amazingly drinkable and be careful because it s a double ipa  just the right amount of citrus           dank  tropical hops jump out of the glass both in the nose and the taste   just fantastic beer once again from tree house   you often find breweries that make great ipas or great stouts but not both   tree house is truly a do no wrong brewery imo   love this and lover tree house   highly recommended          great beer  nice biscuit malt not sweet  explosive tropical hop flavors but i found the beer missing points in the mid palate  not perfectly balanced hence the slightly lower score        wow     first tier ipa the only place this beer fell off a little was the initial feel  i like a little fuller feel  i heard about tree house while on a cape cod road trip  now i have made two b double e double r un  s and both have been fantastic  fun brewery and happy people                  this is my favorite among the ipa s that tree house produces  the thickness of the beer itself let s you capture the complex flavors    canned    look  frothy head and orange hazy goodness  smell  dank  upfront i got tons of weed  after it settles  the tropical smell is more apparent  taste  tons of mangoes and some peaches  finishes with the right amount of sweetness  feel  perfect carbonation  and small bite of bitterness at the end  i think tree house got this down to a science  overall  hard to believe it is a dipa  very easy drinking and delicious  thanks  simsbfb        holy sweet mother of of jesus  this beer is freaking delicious  thanks to my friends dad  i was able to enjoy some of this sweet nectar fresh out of the growler  the only bad thing about this beer  subjective  is that it is dangerously drinkable  i could have easily drank half of the growler in one sitting                  oz can poured into a spiegelau ipa glass  hazy  light amber color with a persistent  creamy  white head  aroma bursts with orange citrus fruit  peach  white wine  and light pine  sweet caramel malts provide a solid base for the citrus hops to shine  there s a slight spice in the finish  which is bitter and long lasting  an assertive beer with tons of flavor  but there is restraint and balance  it s so smooth and clean that not much effort is needed to finish the entire pint  tree house certainly has their hoppy beers dialed in  thanks  ian         poured    from a ml growler that was filled at the brewery on     into an imperial pint glass  a  the beer is a cloudy light gold color  with a short off white head that fades quickly and leaves a spotty lace on the glass  s  the aroma is an excellent blend of strong fruity citrus  floral hops  and caramelized malts  t  the taste starts out with a strong floral hops bitterness that is quickly followed by a strong fruity citrus sweetness  the malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings a good balance  the after taste is hoppy and sweet  m  smooth and very crisp  medium body  medium carbonation  finish is slightly sticky  o  very tasty  goes down quite easily  not too filling  good kick  very good representation of style  this is a very good ipa to drink for a long time             l   classic hazy  golden orange with two fingers of white head s   lots of melon with peach and orange  some breadiness too  t   melon for days  but the peach is also massive  a little bit of grassy hops  but also pure hop juice  finish goes back to peach and stone fruits  f   creamy  doesn t feel like a double ipa as there is no syrupy feeling and no biting resin  o   another winner from these guys  my first dipa from them  but if this is a sign of things to come for th dipas  then i am excited           l  as the name implies  its a cloudy hazey ipa  bright  burnt  orange color with golden glow on the edges  starts with a white silky head that settles down  very appealling and sexy on the eyes  s  as expected  smells of fresh tropical fruit  what really gets me about this beer is how strong the smell is  predominant mango and citrus smell for me  very inviting and intriguing t  taste is amazing  fruit flavors once again come through  which are very sweet  mango  tangerine  and as labeled  peach are predominant flavors  definately some bitterness but its not piney and sharp like some ipas  its tamed by the sweet character of the beer  complex yet so damn enjoyable  f  creamy and rich  the body is heavy  yet because it tastes good it goes back nice and easy  carbonation is somewhat on the light side  the head is pillowy and the body is silky smooth  o  i m not even a wild ipa fan but it doesn t take one to see this is a special beer  it is slightly more bitter than its brother the julius but its similar in taste and smell  top notch   can t beat the feel of a tree house beer  this one has a very strong odor of nail polish remover though  blame it on the hip hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop           look  hazy orange gold smell  citrus  orange and grapefruit  and peach notes taste  juicy tropical citrus taste with a stronger pine resin feel  smooth with a hoppy bit      dated can  finally having this one again after over a year  a  tallboy to a tall  narrow chalice with an extremely hop hazed medium yellow body and a head rising past two fingers  the crown s texture is thick and creamy and it eventually falls to a pillow in the middle and large ring  good retention  s  bright and all hops in the forefront with juiciness in the form of both citrus and tropical stone fruits  things that come to mind are  tangerines  oranges  grapefruit  pineapple  cantaloupe  mango  tropical bubble gum and floral dank tones  strength wise somewhere in the middle of what i expect from tree house  doesn t burst out quite as much as others  t  what strength saturation was missing the smell is instantly found here as it explodes onto the palate like a mixed nectar of citrus and tropical fruit juices  reiteration of things found in the nose but in a somewhat altered order melon  peach and mango up front followed by tangerine  orange  pineapple  grapefruit  dank herbs and floral notes  hints of sweetness and cracker grains while the microbes are kept silent  mf  medium heavy overall body with a texture right down the line between frothy and creamy  the bubbles come down at a moderately high level promoting some seriously zesty and juicy flavors  clean bitter finish  a very smooth and easy drinking    ipa  plenty of juicy flavors with an emphasis on both citrus and tropical tones  another supercharged  pungent hop nectar effort out of monson           appearance  hazy peachy gold  head is bright white and super creamy  sheets and big sticky notches of lacing coat the glass   moderate carbonation on the pour  smell  super juicy  orange  nectarine  peach  and some grapefruit  it s super tropical with a nice citrus edge  orange and grapefruit in abundance under the big tropical push  a slight push of dank earth coupled with a soft spiciness  malts are relatively light with just a touch of caramelized sweetness  some biscuit dough and a touch of pale malt  some weed and a solid dirty pine in the back  peach flesh  grapefruit rind  and a touch of mint leaf  slightly woody  taste  follows the nose to a t  super juicy and tropical with a bunch of orange and grapefruit  successive sips add a touch of dirty pine and a mild woodiness  solid hop spiciness coupled with peach  nectarine  and mango  a touch of fresh mint leaf  malts are relatively light with some pale malt sweetness  a touch of biscuit dough  and a touch of caramelized sweetness  more mango creeps out as it warms  loaded with orange juice and flesh  a touch of grapefruit and orange zest  juiciness drops a touch as it warms  dank and spicy with a soft floral edge  moderately bitter  some hop oil  mouthfeel  creamy medium body with a moderate carbonation  slightly dry on the finish with a slick initial sip and follow through  smooth  overall  tropical weed juice  this is juicy weed in a tropical fruit bowl  a bit messy overall  but everyone should drink this as often as possible              consumed    a  hazy  as advertised   cloudy and hazy  perhaps a little cleaner than tree house green   tangerine gold color  pours with a medium sized  white head   fades to a wispy cap and leaves a really nice web of lacing s  bright  hoppy  and juicy   loads of citrus with some bright  ripe  fresh orange juice and flesh   fleshy grapefruit and some citrus zest   ripe peach flesh and juice   tropical fruit juice  with some pineapple  mango  and passion fruit aromas   lightly spicy  floral citrus  citrusy spice  leafy hops   some pine  some mint   this is a juice bomb  but there is some balance from some doughy  lightly sweet malts   a light touch of caramel  too t  possibly mistaken for fruit juice

caramel   alcohol is extremely well hidden m  medium body  very smooth  creamy  nicely carbonated  somewhat dry finish o  hazed and amazed i have nothing but praise for haze  it s wildly hoppy without actually going over the top  i suppose it could be a bit cleaner overall  but here  the chaos really works  i genuinely like this more than green  once again  i find myself impressed  update  multiple re tastings    i pretty much up my score every time i have this  i adore it       i think i may have found a favorite new dipa  poured from a can into a glass… appearance was cloudy and orange in color  aroma was intense citrus orange  juicy and delicious  the taste was vivid orange and other citrus fruit  bitterness was well balanced with the perceived sweetness from the beer  medium body  the   abv is basically undetectable  i was blown away by this beer… just amazing                            pours a glowing hazy pale orange color  has an intense tropical fruit aroma  has notes of citrus an resin  flavor is bright  citrusy  papaya  has a slightly bitter and crisp finish  leaves a really nice aftertaste  overall this is delicious     dank     unlike julius this one has a better balance of bitterness  true treehouse ipa  haze is imo there best offering to date    the best        perhaps the most unbelievable beer i have ever tasted       juice bomb   pours the haziest orange  resembles mixing fresh squeezed orange juice and fresh squeezed grapefruit juice together  smell is juice  citrus  oranges  clementines  with a sweetness at the end  taste follows the smell perfectly  giant juice bomb  no apparent alcohol taste  feel is perfect  a little thick but it is a double ipa  awesome brew from tree house  close second to julius in my opinion           this beer is yet another slam dunk from tree house  massive citrus aromatics  orange  grapefruit  some pineapple  and ripe peach  hop bitterness is a little more dank and pronounced than some of their other beers  it definitely drinks a little  bigger  than beers like julius and green  malts have a caramel quality to them which increases the richness  mouthfeel has the th signature creaminess  appearance is hazy and beautiful  laces well but not quite as nicely as their regular ipas  in terms of the alcohol bite it is very slightly perceptible  i don t understand what goes on at that brewery or how they figured this out  but they seem to be incapable of making anything less than excellent beer    ridiculously smooth    pours a murky orange that really resembles some type of dark orange juice  the nose is full of stone fruit  mangoes  pineapple and citrus  the body is sweet with a light pine presence and a restrained bitter finish  another slam dunk from tree house     can dated     imploring to  drink me now    drank in a tree house teku on     just an incredible    dipa        poured from a pounder into a tulip glass  appearance  incredibly hazy and vibrant orange color  head is fluffy  long lasting and off white  leaving big puffs of foam on top and a nice ring of lace around the edges  aroma  piles of citrus overwhelm the nostrils  along with a touch of zestiness  the whole room reeks of hops after cracking the can with this one  taste  a ton of citrus and pineapple  mixed in with a solid amount of earthiness  zesty and bitter on the finish  with a lingering dankness  feel  medium bodied  with a relatively dry finish for the hop profile  overall  excellent iipa  another big time hit for th            look   straight orange juice  the typical th haze  their beers are absolutely amazing looking in the glass  smell   pineapple  orange juice  mangos  citrusy  pulpy  some dankness taste   follows the nose  tons of pineapple  tons of tropical fruits  orange  citrus  grapefruit  pithy  insanely drinkable crushable for     feel   signature th  creamy  velvety  smooth  slight alcohol burn on the back end overall   this is one of the best dipas on the planet     period  tree house continues to impress  they are one of the best     if not thee best brewery out there             this beer is one of my favorites from treehouse  which lets be honest anything out of treehouse is my favorite  super citrusy with a punch  canned today so fresher than the prince of bel air     the beer has a super hazy orange color  the aroma is grassy and vegetal  the taste is grassy  vegetal  bubblegum  almost a paint like quality  and has a clean finish          amazing  it s a party in your mouth           oz can  pour turbid orange  thick fluffy head fades slowly leaving lace and clumps of foam on the surface  huge citrusy orange nose  taste follows with sweet orange and tropical fruit  delicious  the hops on this one don t hit until very late in the sip  strong but not unpleasant grapefruit peel and touch of pine  the hops become bitter well after the swallow  semi dry finish and soft medium mouthfeel  another outstanding ipa by tree house  late hops linger a bit long but way good                    oz  can from the source poured into a snifter  days after canning  a  hazy  orange  bubble rising through the haze forming a thick foamy white head  s  citrus  orange juice  orange zest followed by some tropical fruit sweetness  t  big burst of citrus and tropical hop flavors up front balanced with some malt and earthy pine finish  m  moderate carbonation and a fairly high side of medium body  o  great brew  exceptional aroma and flavor and great amount of balance from the malt to allow for the   abv     great tasting american double ipa  from the first smell you can smell the citrus and fruit explosion before putting the glass to mouth  it pours a hazy yellow with a one inch head  the flavor has more hop punch that julius or alter ego  but doesn t make the beer any less smooth  another great treehouse brew     dangerously drinkable for the abv  mango  papaya citrus bomb  there is such a balance for a double ipa and it s not overly bitter  soft on the palate which belies the amount of hops and strength of the brew  awesome    haze is one of the best ipa s coming out of tree house  it s a nice mix of blends and hops  it enhances the spiceness of food and a great stand alone beer  try it with some spicy foods to enhance the food such as papaya salad or spicy wings    it doesn t get much better then this for a dipa       it pours a dull  hazy murky orange  very thin head  it wasn t overly aromatic  there is some light malt sweetness on the front end  but it is the dank  grapefruit and earthy  spicy hop presence that plays the greatest role  a soft mouthfeel  which i ve found typical of tree house hoppy concoctions  this is a very good dipa    smooth  fruity  hidden alcohol  mild bitterness  soft landing  dangerously quaffable   just an incredible beer     pours a nice orangish color     smooth feel with a hint or orange and peach     doesn t have any bitter taste and no aftertaste  one of my favorite beers of all time            received a few cans in a local trade  poured into a th teku glass  pours a orangish color with moderate  white head  smells of tropical citrus  hops  passion fruit  tastes are pretty close to smell    slight bitterness but no booziness detected  the mouthfeel has slight carbonation  medium body  abv is hidden well  overall a very tasty offering from tree house brewing  it is super drinkable and amazing dipa  cheers         oz can poured into a tree house goblet  pours a turbid hazy orange with serious citrus nose  basically the higher abv more hopped up older brother of julius  still drinks like a lower abv brew with amazing mouthfeel and a ton of citrus hops and juicy deliciousness  wish i had more than a few cans       thanks to jakehoodlum for this  oz  silver can  in that seemingly east coast minimalist slap a label on a can blank style  drunking by myself in a hotel room  working  watching the twins  wild card bound  the pour is golden yellow with a solid white cap   active bubbles that are visible even through the  h aze  nose clocks in at strong oranges   more nebulous fruit tones with a sweet smile  not bad  haze is what i’d be in if i had a four pack of this  white bronco hit   run of bitterness right on kick off  with no time for any of the knicker twisting fruits that too many ipas are veering towards  underneath the sneering is classic citrus  light mango   apricot  other tropicals    just a pinch of white pepper  the finish goes slightly grainy with downslope pine  but the bitterness is what really kicks the ending  i could drink a lot of this  matter of fact  i already have  why does my glass look so empty  who’s stealing my beer  unlike some of its east coast compatriots  this is an ipa   not a pale ale with a chevy lift kit bolted on  bitter blast  tasty fruitiness    a ridiculous drinkability that’s just this side of a beer bong  i only have one more of these  i will be cradling it lovingly when i return home  this is an excellent beer that’s only one thin mint away from joining the elite  edit  after not wanting to brush my teeth last night   thinking about this beer several times today  i can t figure why i didn t give this a    on taste  a world class iipa       poured from a can dated   into my gandhi bot snifter glass tonight     thanks andrzej  looks amazeballs  orange with a deep cloudy opaqueness  frothy head leaves great lacing  big orange and mango on the nose  cracking open the can fills the room  instant mouth watering reflex initiated  starts on the flavor sweet  then right into the tropical fruit  more mango and peach here  a touch of sweet orange  finishes dank and leafy with a residual hop flavor after the swallow     abv  yeah right  drinks like    fluffy mouthfeel  another grand slam from tree house              pour   dark gold  hazy  color with fast receding white head smell   tropical pine forest taste   hops hit you out front followed by an even more bitter taste overall   a little on the heavier side  but highly drinkable              received this bad boy as an extra  poured into a teku glass  look  as the name suggests  a hazy golden orange color  nice head retention  smell  mostly pine and fruitiness  taste  really tasty  lots of tropical fruit  not too bitter   which is kind of nice  actually shared this with my non beer drinking sister and she very much enjoyed it  feel  medium body  slightly creamy  overall  a really good iipa  glad i was able to try it  will seek out more tree house brews in the future          got this one in a nice ip trade  hope it s good   oz  can into a tulip  a   hazier than usual   and not quite as bright orange as the others i ve had  but the head is beautiful  tight off white bubbles that are going absolutely nowhere  n   hmm  definitely plenty hoppy  but not bitter at all  i get some bright citrus and not a whole lot else  i would prefer a bit stronger  but this is exactly how i like my ipas to smell  t   ooooo  very nice  really not at all bitter  i do get more pine here than i did in the nose  but otherwise plenty of citrus  not amazingly complex  but a solid all around ipa  m   here s where tree house really shines  somehow all of these ipas turn to froth as soon as they hit my tongue  and it s just wonderful  i don t know how they do it  they just know how to craft a good beer  very wet on the finish  actually  like it s continuously quenching my thirst  nicely done  o   another winner                       poured from a can three weeks old into a pint glass appearance  nice finger of head and great carbonation  blonde  yellow  hazy color  about what you expect from a th hoppy beer  aroma  tons of tropical fruit  pineapple  mango  lime  lemon  orange  also a slight hint of onion  overall smells like pineapple mango juice  taste  follows the noise with tropical fruit flavor  pineapple  mango  and orange   there is also a gum ball like sweetness to the beer which i find very interesting  the finish comes in with bitterness  more than most th beers  and more sweetness  feel  creamy  biscuitty mouthfeel  could be slightly fully for my taste but not thin in the any sense  overall an amazing dipa which i could have over heady or sos  some enjoy julius and green more than this one  but to me they are all slightly different and amazing beers         canned about two weeks ago  tulip glass  a  pours a pale color with two fingers of foamy  off white head  excellent retention and very generous lacing  s  highly aromatic  tangerine  dankness  orange  pale malt  pine  t  apricot  pine  earthiness  tangerine  light crystal malt sweetness  finishing with a mild bitterness  m  medium light body and light  soft carbonation  alcohol is completely hidden  o  endlessly drinkable  very nice flavor which isn’t too fruity or piney  but dry and uncommonly well balanced        the finish on this beer is really unique  tropical fruit on blast  for me at least that s why i love this one     as the name suggest it pour hazy into the glass with a orange hue  very thick head forms right away and dissipates slowly  the aroma is of pine and tropical fruits  there is no indication that it s     it s very drinkable with pine  orange peal and a bit of malt in the finish  outstanding dipa        cloudy in appearance  nice slightly tropical bouquette  but i did not pick up much tropical flavor   rating     ounce can poured into a true blood pint glass  bite me  not as hazy as i thought it would be  half inch head is not going anywhere  nice tropical aroma  taste follows suit  nice mouthfeel  overall  glad i finally got to try this one  this is one of the very few dipa s where the finish doesn t ruin it for me like so  so many other heady wannabes  big thanks to tim fitzgerald  nice job tree house       this is a review from memory i will update when i have it fresh again  poured from a  oz can a few weeks ago  pours a beautiful hazey gold with a fluffy white head  smells of tropical fruit  citrus and hibs  taste of tropical hob juice  wow  fantastic beer i can t wait to get it again     oz growler shipped to nebraska  appearance   golden orange hue  smell   dank pine and big citrus  taste   lots of citrus and super dank pine  very good  feel   perfect carbonation  high attenuation  very drinkable  overall   fantastic ipa  highly recommended  green is slightly better imo    grade  a       one mighty tasty brew with a cool name   thi s and green are my favorite   pours hazy and the name implies   tropical like much of treehouse brews            another solid offering from tree house  light  fluffy hop profile  super bright  tropical hop bit  but with no bitter finish  typical of the new east coast style     personal favorite beer       pours rich and chalky orange with a one finger head  smells of candied fruits  floral with peppery notes and a good heap of citrus  taste is an initial juice bath of pungent of tropical fruits  almost tart  with peppery bitter hops  balanced so nicely for a double  finishes dry and leaves some hop flavor behind  frothy  soft mouthfeel  overall a really excellent double ipa that can hold its own with just about anything  tree house has a real excellent treat in haze         no date  assumed it was fresh  pours a light golden color and was the clearest beer i have had from th  balanced and very smooth for an   dipa  as always  they don t dissapoint              poured from the can into a spiegelau ipa glass  one week after canning sale at tree house brewery  pale apricot orange body color  and slightly cloudy  lemon edges towards the bottom  head is a solid growing four fingers  simple white and very fine bubbles in the head formation  sits like an even puck  island clumping in the middle with excellent pill and ring like lacing  staying power  and retention  wonderful mix of dank and earth notes of hop on the nose  heavily woody  with hints of burnt pine and great smokey dank quality on the hop  mouth watering quality  palate really makes a great impression  instead of a dank slam of weeds  a big juiced body comes in large and full  mild sensing tangerine orange  even tropical guava fruit in the mid palate  finishes thick and almost velvet like with a great pine bitterness of earth on the aftertaste  big and in control  well contrasted between fruit and earth qualities  perfect amount of sweetness in the malt coming through with just a wonderful balance between sweet and bitter  and hop earth and fruit  fantastic well made dips that actually comes off more like a great balanced ipa       poured from oz can into a teku  crisp hazy golden color with zero transparency  nice lingering one finger head  smells of pine and mango  taste is fantastic  has that east coast iipa feel but very easy on the finish  overall another great beer from treehouse             ml growler  filled  jul   poured into whisky glass on  aug  thanks to marino for the awesome trade  this reminds me of a buffer sibling to tg s pseudo sue due to the juicy peaches and mangos  super dank  but it s surprisingly got a clean finish  very interesting     pour is light golden amber with lots of fluffy white head and a decent lacing  nose is huge grapefruit rind  really rindy musk  light grain profile  clean  flavor is the same  a little less of the rind  more tropical  very low bitterness  light body  softer carb    can from the most recent release  tried this and curiosity  in the same night and haze was the winner  just a tremendous double ipa  i ve yet to have a hoppy beer from tree house that hasn t been excellent        oz can poured into a shoe  pours a hazed golden light orange with a creamy dense and bubbly off white head leaving behind thick sheets of lace  nose of citrus  bready malt and spice  orange  grapefruit rind  cracker  pepper  grass  creamy smooth body  thick and full  with dry mildly bitter finish  flavor is dominated by pine and citrus rind  smooth bitterness and a strong bready malt base with a light grassy pepper spiciness  a solid   easy drinking  pine and citrus iipa though not a standout from tree house or others         look   poured into teku glass from ml  golden haze with a nice head and lacing  smell   citrus  pine  and tropical fruit  getting a slight grainy malt aroma on the end  taste   unique  tropical and citrus fruit with a bit of pine  feel   smooth with very little carbonation  very easy drinker for     overall   not the best example of a tree house beer and definitely not my favorite  still this is very good and crushable  will update my review after tasted from the  oz cans for comparison   tasted out of the can and it was better  not sure why but it seemed to be more balanced than the ml    great american double ipa  goes down super smooth  has an addictive taste to it as you drink it  updated review  not sure if the last batch i had was simply off  or something was off with me  but this time around it s world class in every way  hazier than before  aroma is rich with citrus and grassy hops  flavor is well balanced but full bodied  very very juicy    bomber poured into antique pilsner glass pours an opaque golden orange liquid with a thick   billowy generous two finger white foamy cap   great lacings  aroma of gentle pine  sweet pineapple  orange rind and hint of peppery spice  taste of tropical fruits  orange and citrus  pine hops low carbonation  smooth as silk  mild pine hop bitter aftertaste   well balanced  another fine tree house beer            poured into teku from growler filled on    at tree house brewing  pours the color of orange pulp with an enormous frothy white head  lacing is abundant  smell is a blast of orange rind  sweet pineapple  grapefruit with a slight piney note as well  taste is a bit bitter up front but the citrus notes take over quickly  some breadiness from pilsner malt    peeks in there and then fades into a slightly bitter finish  feel is medium with no signs of the  abv at all  another deliciously beautiful beer from tree house  can they do anything wrong     poured from a  liter growler poured at the brewery  days ago  this is one fantastic dipa  honestly i just haven t had a bad beer yet from these guys  but haze is such  well balanced dipa  very citrusy  fruit bomb full of flavor and smooth as hell  with a little bit of bitterness on the back end  but that s ok and too be expected from the style  i don t enjoy dipas that are too malt forward or too bitter  but this is neither  just a great example of this style and a beer that i will come back to at every opportunity that i get     picked up six cans at the brewery  hints of grass in smell and taste  nice  but comes up rd behind green and julius as far as tree house offers      a  like most of the treehouse brews  perfect  nice and pale yellow cloudyness good head  and lacing down the glass  s  quite fruity citrusy  i get lots of orange pineapple smell  with some more hop piney at the end t  kind of a mix between green and julius  but not the same level as either  it has some fruityness and then some dank piney hops but neither reach the level as the other two beers  but still a top ipa haha f  little better then green and on the same level as julius where its a little thicker but still leaves a little stickyness feeling on the tongue  o  another amazing one from treehouse slightly behind julius and green but still one of the best ipas      slightly spicy pine nose  tastes of lemon  orange zest  papaya  and peach with a bitter pine finish  not quite on the level of green or julius but this ones up there  could be most breweries best beer  that characteristic depth of hop flavor is mind bogglingly good   tree house is doing it right  best brewery by far   pint can into a shaker glass  pours  erm  hazy  smells citrusy with light notes of pine  tons of straight up orange with a little bit of mango in there  very nice  but nothing super exceptional  tastes like it smells  light pine hops up front  moving into a middle that s dominated by tropical fruit nodes  and then ending with some bready malt and more pine  the balance is pretty good and the smoothness is exceptional for a beer of this strength  i don t know if this quite counts as one of the best beers i ve ever had  or  actually  i do  and it isn t  but just because it didn t  quite  live up to the hype doesn t mean it s not excellent        this is a booze laden beast  it s dangerously smooth  and like many th beers  it s loaded with juiciness  one  ouncer will put you into a haze  but two might knock you on your butt  great balance of alcohol and taste  a winner in my books  find this beer now  if you haven t already        pours a cloudy dark orange color with a huge white frothy head  the odor is ipa  grapefruit  orange  apricot  pineapple  peach  resin  slightly spice  slightly honey  pine like  malty  berry  slightly grassy  the taste is fruity  orange  pine  peach  not very bitter  a little grassy dry on the back end         orange zest and stone fruits on the nose  really balanced  drinks smoothly for a double ipa  had a tone of excellent ipa s recently  oh and ht  lunch   but this definitely stood out              so beautiful and delicious  a perfect example of the style  dank dank dank   enjoy by  on crack with the east coast touch  tastes of resiny dank tropical fruit  probably the best dipa ive ever had        easy drinking for    abv tastes smells like candied fruit  fantastic stuff soft mouthfeel  very refreshing      these guys know how to make beer       since i rated julius a    i can only rate this a   but this is even more lucious and delicious than julius  these guys are amazing         another juice bomb from tree house  crazy amount of tropical fruits jammed into this one  i am absolutely in love with this one  pours translucent yellow  smells of  you guessed it  a ridiculous amount of fruit  tastes as it smells  amaxing  tons of juice up front with a nice bitter hop bite at the end  wonderfuly done  mildly carbonated very fluffy mouyhfeel  delightful double ipa  will buy every chance i get   poured from a oz  tree house brewing growler into a new tree house stemmed snifter glass  the color is slightly hazy orange with two fingers of thick white head and some nice lacing left on the glass  the smell is fruity with some touches of grapefruit and a really nice pine aroma  there is a spruce or douglas fur aroma here that is slightly christmas like for the pine needle aroma  there is a slight bready aroma that is a little dry and sweet  the taste is fruity with some touches of orange  lemon  and peach coming out at first in a welcoming spark to a wonderful flavor voyage  there is a slightly biscuit flavor toward the back that pushes out just a little until the end  the last traces of this beer finishes at a bitter but fruity exclamation point and then gently leads into a loose aftertaste that has haunts of the same fruit flavor there with a slight pine flavor at the edges  the feel of this beer is smooth for a double ipa and really behaves more like low abv pale ale for the most part  there is a bit of a kick that does come when really getting into this beer and not letting it breathe  the higher levels of this beer can be felt even if it’s rushed       as the name suggests pours a hazy brownish orange with a half inch fluffy white head  taste was orange  grapefruit  light sugar  mild bitterness  very drinkable  with a nice balance  this was a very solid beer      this didn t have any flaws  but it also didn t have a big personality  great beer  but falls a bit short of the hype           oz can poured into a snifter  a  pours a deeply hazed orange color  bubbly white head settles to a half inch cap  wispy lacing  s  orange and peach  fruit cocktail  hints of passion fruit and sweet bud  whiff of soft pine  toasty and bready undertones  t  orange  grapefruit  passion fruit  earthy hop notes of soft pine  bark  and sweet cannabis too  oily  bitterness is firm and even throughout  faint bready and toasty malt contribution  maybe caramel too  quick flash of bubblegum  trailing finish or orange wedges and sweet bud  m  medium thick body  soft and creamy texture  gently prickling carbonation  hop astringencies grip a bit  but are relatively tame  o  well whaddaya know  another awesome ipa dipa from tree house  the hits keep coming  dank  fruity  citrusy  loads of hop flavor without a lot of bite  creamy smooth body  it s every hop head beer geek s wet dream     enjoyed multiple tall boys canned within a couple weeks and the same goddamn day  deep dank and citrusy aroma accompanies the murky golden pour  heavy notes of orange  grapefruit  mango and papaya are followed by a sticky  bitter wave that combines to create an incredibly tasty double ipa  just the slightest hint of alcohol adds a little heat to the proceedings  as is tree house s trademark  the beer leaves you with a creamy and crisp impression  big flavors  soft body  world class dipa      poured from a oz can into a tree house snifter  purchased this past week  pours a golden orange body with a frothy white head that reduces slowly to leave decent retention and spotty lacing  aromas are inviting and fresh   grapefruit  tropical fruit  creamy malt  floral notes  citrus  on the tongue is raw  fresh tropical hops  citrus  orange creamsicle  bursting citrus  followed by a slightly resinous  fresh floral aftertaste  very nice mouthfeel  medium body  creamy  raw feel  very tropical  overall one of the best dipas i ve ever had  period           another perfect example from tree house           decent enough tasting honey colored beer  but for being a double ipa and over   a can i was disappointed in the lack of fullness and real double ipa laden tastes       look  nice  one finger head  nice lacing smell  citrus   orange and grapefruit  less orange and sweet that tree house julius  taste  like it smells  i could sense the alcohol a bit  very fruity and well balanced overall  a great double ipa that i enjoy as much as sip of sunshine           great iipa here   almost too smooth  love this juice  these last few batches have been insane  the juice that you smell from the crack of the can follows through right to the taste  its amazing   top  iipa for me       wow  there is no other way to describe this beer other than wow  sooooooo juicy       consumed directly from a  oz  can  appearance   no idea  silver can  smell   orange and kinda tropical  sweet smelling taste   orange  grapefruit  sweet caramel  lots of booze in it too  less tropical here  more sweet pale malt and orange  mouthfeel   medium heavy  creamy mouthfeel  overall   tasty  but too sweet and boozyfor me to hit the heights of othe tree house hoppy beers                 as i crack the can  the delightful aroma of ripe passion and tropical fruit fills the air  mango  guava  papaya  with a bit of stone fruit  the pour yields a slightly turbid golden orange with a fluffy white head  the first sip gives way to mango  tropical fruit punch  floral hints  along with orange marmalade and grapefruit  honey and cracker malt backs the mild bitterness  mouthfeel is soft and velvety  with a slight lingering bitterness that finishes dry and grassy  i didn’t have to think very hard to realize this beer reminds me very much of sos  enjoy and savor this one        fantastic  not much nose  great balance   dull and bitter  bland malt and excess sugar  not sure what s up with this because it s not what i was expecting    pours a hazy orange color  not unlike every other th ipa  this is not a knock  the aroma is   orgasmic  i can t think of any other word for it  it s so citrusy but has a hint of pine and honey that really balances it out  orange and grapefruit dominate the nose  but i detect hints of mango  as well as something sweeter  berry    either way  this is one of the best smelling beers i ve ever experienced  it s not  in your face  like heady topper  but the subtlety is brilliant  i simply adore the aroma this beer possesses  the taste is very tropical  orange  dragonfruit  grapefruit  the piney bitterness is present  but not pronounced  some grassy undertones form the basis of a truly remarkable dipa  the mouth is unbelievable  this is a dipa yet it drinks like a pale ale  it is so smooth and  dare i say  light  that you will easily forget you are drinking a beer with an   abv  while this isn t quite as balanced as julius  it might just be the best beer tree house has to offer    pours a hazy straw color  the smell is heavy with orange  sweet fruit  and a bit of pine  the taste follows the nose  big tropical fruit tastes with a slight bitter finish  an amazing iipa        enjoyed from a  oz  can that was poured into a tree house tulip  a citrusy hop bomb that s so smooth you can t really tell that it s an imperial ipa  it has a lot of similarities to julius  but it s not quite as balanced  a real treat to drink and certainly better than the vast majority of ipas you will find on your local retailer s shelves  if monson  ma is within driving distance  make the trek  otherwise  add it to your iso trading list  delicious    l   a bright  clementine juice  no gradient  solid floury hue throughout that looks gorgeous in the light  s   has a slightly tart sour stringent aroma  has a certain aroma i can t quite pinpoint  spicy grapefruit rind  maybe  kiwi  guava  peach  t   peach punch  the best part about this beer is the upfront peachy juicy blast that assails the tastebuds and blows flavor out the nose  pungent grapefruit tang in the middle  light  unripe mango with a mild acidity  dies down as quickly as it came  and settles into a candied peach sweetness helped along by the booze  f   soft and buoyant  slight syrup due to the booze  refreshing relief from the fruity acidic fruitiness  o   a great beer that it pains me to admit is sometimes not the best  depends  batch to batch  sometimes it s unbelievably pungent and juicy  and other times it just tastes sticky and flavorless  but when it s good  it s good  hot damn  i should note that in the past year or so     this beer has improved tremendously in both flavor and consistency  i d like to rescind that previous comment                 a excellent double ipa  it has a wonderful hoppy flavor with a the taste of citrus from start to finish  the aftertaste is slighly bitter but smooth  very refreshing and tasty      a  not like the purp  but hazy peach fuzz with burst of orange in color  nice enough ivory head and good lacing  s  orange blossom and grapefruit  passionfruit  some grassiness and honey  m  smooth  medium feel  almost silky  approaches a full very well rounded body but has a tart snap at end  slightest booziness  s  ends with peach and other stone fruit  pineapple orange slush  pine throughout  underripened tropical fruit  papaya and guava  earthiness of lychee fruit  grapefruit bitters  dank juiciness       thanks steve  enjoyed from a treehouse taster  murky yellow spotty lace  nose and taste is big time nectarine  kilin it  little boozy but awesome      another gem by th  boy can these guys do no wrong    citrus bomb in a can   extremely crisp refreshing   extreme hops added to this one  great stuff   tropical notes galore        a   pours a hazy  cloudy medium to dark tan orange color  thin lacing ring  light carbonation  s   a touch of tea leaves along with a lot of tropical fruit aroma  mango  papaya  and orange  t   tropical frutiness from start to finish that follows the nose minus the tea leaves   mangos  papaya  orange  lemon  grapefruit with a medium bittersweet finish  m   medium body and with all the hops your mouth gets a healthy coating and creates a somewhat cotton like feel after awhile and the    is completely hidden in the beginning but surfaces  just a tad  as the beer warms  o   this is a fine double ipa worth trying  not a    rating imo but really darn good      it s amazing beer advocate changed the rating system  now  only ratings that come with a review of  characters will count  they ve now just discounted thousands of ratings just because they want  quality   well guess what  you now have a smaller sample size and beers with only  ratings are cracking the top   so stupid  it s   people are busy  i don t want to spend  minutes describing my feelings about every beer i drink    mango  pineapple  fresh cut hay  extremely fresh and clean  a wonderful experience drinking this    very good brew  initially was not impressed  but as i got further into the beer i really became a fan     a  bright shade of orange  apricot   hazy with a thin white lacing  s  there s a lot going on here  very complex  smells incredibly tropical   mango  melon  tangerine  pineapple  papaya  banana  t  bursting with citrus and a nice piney hoppy finish  has more of an earthy  crispness to it  slight bitterness  hint of orange aftertaste  m  medium carbonation  hops prickly to the tongue  goes down smooth  very refreshing  o  i like this  a lot  reminds me of a more hoppy version of green  i was lucky enough to pick up a can of this  fresh via a trade  the freshness contributes to the complexity of flavors aroma  this is big boy beer right here       special thanks to gmr for this outrageous extra  a   hazy apricot body  almost hefeweizen like  cream white head pours a finger high with nice retention and fantastic lace  s   really nice nose  citrusy with orange  papaya and grapefruit  banana  cilantro  alspice  and green pineapple backend  t   interesting flavor profile  really fresh and really green  with a semi sweet resiny finish  fresh cut grass  sweet squash  bread crust  fresh green papaya  and honey  great integration  m   smooth medium body  murky finish  o   relatively unique flavor profile for the style  with lots of bright  pleasantly green  under ripe  fruit flavors      from a fresh growler filled     truly fastastic to all the senses           this beer poured out as a haze d  golden color with a nice white head on top  the smell of the beer is very hoppy  lots of fruity tropical aromas  the taste of the beer is much like the nose  lots of hops flavors in here  the feel of the beer is very smooth  overall this beer is great  just like all the other tree house beers                           serving was out of a ml growler to pint glass  day after bottling   bottled april th   look  as the name implies  a hazy  deep golden orange  a crisp but sticky half finger head with a decent lacing  smell  peach  apricot and orange  maybe a touch of mango or some other tropical fruit  taste  peach and mango notes at first followed with a well balanced bitterness  a hint of orange on the finish  very fresh  clean taste almost like fresh air  i also get an earthy almost woody note towards the end  feel  crisp on the tongue with tight carbonation  but not overwhelming  just right  light and drinkable  finishes a bit dry  overall  im very impressed with my nd offering from tree house  i was blown away by their curiosity  as well  from the very little i ve tried from these guys they seem to have it together very well  complex and well balanced beers to say the least  every sip seems to bring out new flavors  we will definitely be going back to fill our growlers soon    tree house has perhaps the most loyal fan base of any brewery i have visited  so at times it is difficult to gauge how good their beers actually are when you finally brush aside the hype and taste the beer for yourself  this beer was good  but with vermont s big three readily available for me on a fairly consistent basis  it fell short of my expectations  still  in the absence of some of the other big dipa s  this one would certainly deliver on flavor and feel            my post ebf treat  bottled march     absolutely gorgeous foamy head  pineapple colored body  sharp citrus aroma with dry mango  lemon zest and pineapple in flavor  quite good          growler was poured into a nonic glass  appearance  a one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer  it is a hazy golden yellow orange color with no vision of anything  frothy lacing down the glass as the beer was drank  smell  juicy hops  tropical  citrus  grassy  earthy  spicy  and danky hops followed by biscuity  toasted  and pale malts  taste  got to love those juicy hops  nice malt backbone and light tingly bitterness  i keep going back for more  tasty and delicious  mouthfeel  smooth  medium bodied  refreshing  tasty  medium carbonation  and slight bitterness in the rear  overall  another awesome beer from these settled guys  good to see the new brewery and let s hops the production of all their brews increases soon too  this growler isn t going to last long               the aroma is subdued  i get slight notes of orange and citrus bitterness  but it s quite boozey  this is not my favorite by treehouse   pours a murky light apricot color  just say no to clear beers      smell of citrus and tropical fruits    taste of pine  resin  and citrus  with a currently indescribable fruity aftertaste  maybe kiwi   and a mild bitterness very tasty and addicting     yes  this beer is as close to perfect as a beer can be  this is heaven in a glass                            another home run from treehouse  as the name suggests  this pours a very cloudly hazy yellow orange  decent head and the smell is fresh grass and some citrus  one of the more drinkable beers out there  taste is similar to the smell  almost refreshing  tl dr   this beer is good    thanks  mikeyv for sharing your bottle  a  nice white head sits on top of a hazy orange  nice lacing s  unreal  orange explosion  tangerine  pineapple  every tropical fruit you can imagine  caramel sweetness  maybe  its hard to smell anything besides that powerful fruit t  absolutely follows the nose as expected  fruit explosion  almost overwhelms your mouth  in a good way  and then switches to a hop bite but smooth all the way  malt is there just enough to make this   beer dangerously smooth and drinkability is high m  medium and smooth  didn t dry me out very much o  never have i had such a flavorful tropical dipa  it was sweet but not boozy  with the right mixture of hops and malt  like  hops  malt ratio  which is just where i like it in a dipa  looking forward to more tree house beers  incredible    piney  citrusy  sticky resins  but surprisingly delicate  very good                      true to it s name this beer is hazy in the best possible way  tropical fruits explode from the glass and the abv is completely hidden  rounded out by the typical tree house mouthfeel  full and soft            ml thb swing top bottle filled at the brewery  first thb glass pours with a    white head  over the cloudy burnished gold brew  head deflates slowly  with leggy lasting lace  aroma is piney hoppiness  taste starts sweet  mouth puckering citrus in the middle  then pine and bitter take over through the close  mouthfeel is soft and smooth  and drinkability is dangerously easy  wow  great representative of the style         maybe better than julius               oz can from recent batch  poured into a th tulip  hazy golden orange color with an off white head  beer is opaque  cannot see through it at all  smell of mosaic hops is there but this smells off a bit  almost a musty smell mixed in with the mosaic  flavor is also not right with this  almost tastes watered down  the mosaic seems muted and not very pronounced  feel is creamy as all th beers tend to be  overall  good not great  this recent can is quite the disappointment       ml bottle bought at the brewery oct    poured from the ml bottle into a tree house tulip pint  a  hazy orange with a finger thick white head which receded to even surface foam and dense lacing  s  strong pine resin and grapefruit  t  follows the nose  and the accompanying hop bite is considerable  yet little bitterness on the tongue  although what seems to be alcohol throat burn is noticeable at first  m  medium to full  plenty of carbonation tingle  o  a powerful and flavorful dipa with lots of danky hop goodness  dangerously drinkable  update     out in pint cans now  bought six at the brewery today  raising my ratings for appearance and mouthfeel from   to            thanks superhop  ml growler dated october     pours a hazy straw with a thin quickly dissipating head  tangerine and peaches on the nose  this is one great smelling dipa  slightly bitter citrusy up front with a touch of dank  finishes dry  medium body with light carbonation  overall  this a well balanced  supremely crafted iipa  good job tree house                                the beer comes in an opaque rich rich golden orange  absolutely beautiful  the aroma offers sweet orange candy  tangerine  papaya  juicy fruit  hints of green grass and pine  the flavor follows with that juicy fruit bubble flavor upfront  along with tropical fruit  nectarine  guava  then there s a touch of sweetness as the beer transitions onto orange candy and tangerine  on the back  a slight grassiness balance with orange zest  an absolute knockout from tree house    was lucky to have this at tree house on    on the first day it was ever released  a murky deep orange with some amber as well  s  blast of fruit  juice  tropical smells  ripen mango and pluots  t  reminds me of a heavier version of julius  not as perfect as julius but damn close  like a glass of orange mango juice  sweet  great hoppiness  bitter in the best way it can be  f  chewy  juicy  creamy  leaves the mouth watering  o  this is what dipas should aspire to be  the crew at tree house is awesome and are making the best ipas on the planet right now       picked up a couple of bottles of haze from brewer dean at tree house  sent one out to my fellow members of the chicago beer snobs in chicago  and shared the other with my brother yesterday  this is not only a great brew  but one that is extremely drinkable  don t know if we are correct  but we tasted a little bit of peach maybe  the alcohol does not present itself  stays well hidden  i know dean hangs with our vermont brewers at lawson s and hill farmstead  and i can say from the quality of this brew he well deserves to hang with those guys  great brew  hard to come by  but if you are in central mass area seek it out  congrats dean                                         ml swing top  purchased today  into a tree house teku  a  pours a medium orange with two fingers of foamy white head that fades to a nice lace  beer is slightly hazy but i ve seen wayyy cloudier  looking at you heady     s  sweet tropical fruit just punches you in the nose with tangerine  mango  and orange  subtle caramel malt sweetness and a touch of grass  t  up front tropical fruit  loads of tangerine  mango  orange and grapefruit  was described by the brewery as  oj  and while not quite that far  this is a citrus bomb  there is some pine and earthy flavors but the citrus clearly dominates  m  medium bodied with nice crisp carbonation and relatively low bitterness  drinks easily and goes down smooth  o  this is a great dipa from tree house that i m thankful to get to try  i have another  that i ll surely be sharing with friends      just got and drank batch   of haze  each batch is a little different   they use different hops  haze is fruity and surprisingly smooth for an    dipa  if i could pick just one flavor  i d say it tastes like tangerines  it has the citrus orange fruit up front  with a little bite like the pith from citrus fruit  and a little tangyness to it  i get very minimal malts  as the beer warms it really opens up   more citrus  some mango  papaya  even peach  really tasty stuff and nice work from the guys at tree house            growler shared by lunch  thanks paul  the beer is in fact hazy  loads of citrus character  dank hops and oranges  tangy with a subtle sweetness  mild bitterness and lingering citrus  tasty       ml swingtop growler into a founders snifter  pours a   finger foamy white head with great retention  beer is a cloudy mango  great  thick lace and just a great looking beer overall  nose is typical northeastern iipa  fruity  sweet and aromatic and real appetizing  flavor opens sweet mango  pineapple  starfruit  and citrus  amazing  cane sugar sweetness in the middle with just the right amount of citrus hop bitterness to balance things out  really delicious  medium bodied with moderate carbonation  smooth in the mouth and goes down easy and slightly dry  finishes dry with a resiny aftertaste  pulls the flavor together nicely  the first beer i ve had from tree house is definitely a winner  a very solid ipa that provides an incredible experience from nose to flavor to feel  i m looking forward to more from these guys         ml growler poured into a bell s snifter     a  hazy  as i had figured  light yellow body  two finger white head with great retention  very nice thick rings of lacing  altogether a very nice looking dpa  certainly lives up to the name  s  floral  citrus  pine hops hit you in the face along with a nice pale malt caramel sweetness that balances out the hop aromas  a bit simplistic to be sure  but very delicious just the same  f  pine  pine  orange  grapefruit  cut by some grassiness and sweet  honeyed bread and cracker flavours  quite well balanced in terms of flavours  but the hops do stand out  m  medium in body  good carbonation with a nice creamy feel that makes it so drinkable  not particularly bitter on the finish despite all the hop aromas and flavours  o  very nice double pale ale that is quite a bit different in character than julius  definitely worth seeking out       on draft at the brewery  tropical fruit hop juice  creamy feel  perfectly balanced  mango  papaya  pineapple and orange  creamy  light and pillowy feel  fairly dry finish  real good                       oz  growler served in a nonic  thanks joe   bottled     pours a translucent straw gold with a tight    inch  bright white head  head eventually dissipates into a consistent skim  some lacing present  but poor adherence for the most part  nose expresses bright citrus notes  a hint of ethanol and something else  perhaps herbal or oniony  it s hard to tease out  citrus in the flavor profile is just as bright and akin to tangerines or clementines  with a mild hops bittering at the finish to break up the sweetness between quaffs  mouthfeel is light medium with an even carbonation and some acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands  texture is slightly oily  overall  another exceptional beer from treehouse  i just wish they were closer                 a a thin  white head grows and dies before my eyes  clearish body is bright honey in color  almost zero lace  s not as aromatic as i ve come to expect treehouse s world class brews to be  it s too soft but i do like what s there  peach and nectarine hops along with grass and citrus  pale  subtle malt sweetness  t flavor is clearly better  tropical fruits  some pineapple  peach and apricot hops  grassy and floral hops as well  tangerine  some sweetish hop flavor accompanied by a breadiness  has a melon flavor from the hops as well  m not overly bitter  no heat  medium bodied with some hop resin  medium carbonation  aftertaste doesn t linger for too long  o a very good beer but not my favorite treehouse brew  still better than much of what i can consistently get my hands upon  always a treat to cop some nectar from the brewers in monson    apperance   bright orange in color   fingers of white head  crystal clear with streaming bubbles  aroma  strong pine  grass aroma  grapefruit  a hint of mango  touch of bready malt taste  one of the best beers i have tried this year  very well balanced and the tasting notes follow the aroma pine some grapefruit and hint of mango  the bitternes is there to balance the sweetness in the malt but it does not overpower your palate                     first time i ve had this in a while   still one of my favorites   obviously juicy  great body and carbonation  just enough bitterness and malt   not too much funk like many neipas      a   poured into a tree house teku  pours a golden orange color with a moderate white  nice retention and light lacing  s   aromas of tropical citrus fruits  oranges  passion fruit  earthy hops  light hints of malts  t   taste follows the nose very well  slight bitterness  flesh citrus fruit  no booze detectable  m   medium body  moderate carbonation  alcohol hidden well  o   overall a very well balanced beer  very easy to drink  the abv is not noticeable  refreshing  this was my first dipa from them and i am yet again happily surprised by the quality of their brews                   growler filled yesterday  shared with rudzud and threelions  decent creamy   finger head fades med pace  nice sticky lacing  semi hazy orange honey color  nice legs too  column of streaming bubbles  nose brings dank resin  nice generic tropical fruits  kiwi hops  some grapefruit pith and little orange rind  nice overall fruity  with mild pine to go with the resin and dankness  tangerine  clementine  etc  taste starts with tons of citrus  orange juice  tangerine clementine  little mango and papaya like  juicy citrus fruit  little rind and pith  mild pine  very light  and some resin and darkness  little hop oil  so much juicy citrus  little generic tropical fruit  kiwi hops  etc  decent but mild malt profile  great balance  finish is drier  little resin and hop oil  light bitterness but nice citrus and tropical fruits lingering  little rind and pith  mouth is med bod  no booze  maybe a touch thin  decent carb  overall pretty great  not quite julius or green  more like somewhere in between  but still very nice             visited the tree house brewery tonight  was a very welcoming  enjoyable visit  appearance   golden hue  hazy in recent versions  thin head  smell   hoppy  orange smell  tropical smell taste   hoppy citrus taste with no booze taste  very fresh tasting  mouthfeel   nice  again alcohol well hidden  overall   a good  solid double ipa  i find it to be better than  but similar to  dirtwolf  which is a compliment in my mind    thanks to jlindros for sharing  a   poured into a kate the great tulip a nice crystal clear light golden hue with a thin one finger head that faded to leave light lacing and a nice foamy halo and wispy  s   aromas of big  dank hops big resinous notes  orange peel  grapefruit  light tropical notes  really assertive wet hops  hardly any malts  t   taste is similar to the nose  though flopped with resinous and citrus  nice candy orange notes  light grapefruit  wet lightly bitter notes  much less bitter than i thought it would taste  no booze detectable  nice citrus hop notes  fleshy fruit  m   mouthfeel is really nice  lightly carbonated  alcohol hidden well  o   overall this beer was pretty good  however  not my favourite double ipa from then  still good though      oz can  pours a hazy  shocking  burnt yellow with an inch of frothy head  good amount of lacing  the aroma is orange  peach  papaya  pineapple and pink grapefruit  the taste is papaya  orange and pink grapefruit  peach and papaya towards the end with some bread crusts  medium body with low carbonation  pretty noticeable alcohol presence  creamy mouthfeel      canned on     consumed on     pretty much as fresh as you can get it        a  poured from the can into a palm tulip  body is hazy golden yellow with a small off white head that settles quickly  leaving behind some splotchy lace  s  big nose of hop juice  think grapefruit  more generic citrus  tangerine peel  lemon   peach skins  nectarines and even under ripe plums  t  taste doesn t quite live up to the nose in sheer forcefulness  but it s quite pleasant  kinda like pineapple orange juice  with loads of grapefruit  ripe mangoes  and stone fruit  apricot  all present at one time or another  finishes with a more green bitterness   pine or grass comes to mind   which washes over the palate but is quickly overtaken by the more sweet juiciness of oranges  grapefruit and even limes  m  juicy and smooth  call it medium in heft but it feels a little lighter  o  awesome  incredible  phenomenal  pick a word    from zombier  in teku glass  canned  aug  bit of letdown  good nose but not as fruity as expected in mouth and with vegetal bitter point that initially sees bad but improves with time        while i like green more  this is a delectable hoppy offering from th  amidst the peach and pineapple there s a light bubblegum  esters on the nose  creamy  slightly dank  a touch of onion  but mostly juicy peach on the palate  the finish is candied fruit and only a touch of bitterness               picked up from a friend at patriots tailgate  this is my fourteenth brew from these guys  this is a very solid brew  but not one of my favorites from th  too lightly carbonated  not enough flavor    canned this morning  as fresh as it gets  overall this beer seemed flat  the color was a dull gold  the beer is thick and solid   fully opaque  the smell is mildly sweet  the brewery had the same mild aroma today  taste is subtle  nothing is over powering in it and the feel has a faint bite that lingers and mellows with time  for a dipa this is an easy drinker  i am excited to enjoy some for the next week or so and see how it grows         pours hazy yellow orange  great looking beer  the smell is a ton of tropical notes  mango  passion fruit with some tangerine  fantastic smell to it  the taste is just how the smell set it up  great citrusy fruits flavor  tastes like it’s be soaking in mango and tangerine  love the taste  the feel is as good as it gets  so clean and smooth  each sip is so clean and crisp  the entire beer remains so consistent  so impressed with this beer on so many levels  this lives up to the hype for sure  amazed how well put together this is            poured from a can dated    to a nonic  very hazy  reminds me of apricot juice  in appearance   mild fruit aroma  pineapple  orange  mango  really a nice taste of the same fruits  finish is effervescent and mildly bitter  and thats the kicker  it changes at the end and not in an unpleasant way  mouth feel is good also  really coats your tongue until that carbonation starts cleaning house  this is probably my favorite tree house neipa and certainly one of my favorite overall neipas      super smooth  not much to comlain about a great ipa     poured from can into teku glass  thick hazy appearance typical of an neipa with a soft pillowly mouthfeel  strong citrus auroma almost smells like orange juice at first  taste notes of citrus and tropical fruits with a smooth finish that stays with you  does not drink like a double which could creep up on you after a few  overall fantastic beer highly recommend               poured from a can into a wine glass           you know i like my yellow mud beer  heavy lacing  smells like bitter orange juice with a hint of bubblegum  smooth  light  and delectably drinkable neipa  doesn t particularly present as a double   some added hop bitterness from the bottom of the can  some apricot  grapefruit  peel   and spritzy  moreish body  very yummy ne style  d  ipa  but not going to rock anybody s world in     excellent ips with fantastic taste of citrus and hops  not too aggressive  just a good smooth dipa  have had  cans  yummy   orange juice with a thin head that leaves a sticky ring smells of peach  apricot  tropical fruits taste follows nose with tons of peach and orange juice followed by tropical fruits and then a mild piney bitterness mouthfeel is excellent  creamy yet fluffy with mild carbonation overall this is one of the best new england ipas ive had    a perfect beer  fluffy body  huge citrus and peach notes and it tastes like eating a peach  all of that is followed up by some nice light dankness to add some complexity to the brew  an all day drinker    oz can  into glass pale yellow color  thick white head  good head retention  dank  piney  resin hop aroma  similar flavor  mild malt component to the taste  medium bitterness      canned        “you got one life  haze on” orange juice twin  totally opaque  no floaters  head when poured is swallowed by the murk  with a persistent ring and blanket on the surface  unusual jagged peaks of lacing aroma of tangerine  peach  a little overripe grapefruit bordering on spoiled  pine  intriguing mix  taste is more bitter orange  guava  peach  smooth first sensation with a bitter tickle on the middle of the tongue  medium substantial body  unique in all respects  very enjoyable       looks like a true hazy ipa  murky but still clean  the smell is a little fruity but you can definitely get the hops that come through that make it an ipa  i didn t like the taste at first  thought it was a little too plain but the more i drank it  the more it grew on me  true ipa with the hoppiness cut by the haze          hazy and delicious  has a certain smoothness like a banana  very enjoyable   the smoothie of beers   look  hazy orange  looks almost like a mimosa but obviously with a much bigger head  off white   finger head  retention looks good  moderate to high carbonation from looking at the bubbles  heavy lacing on the glass  smell  jumps out of the glass when i was pouring it  the can description is on the nose  orange juice and peach are easily identifiable  tropical fruit is also there  they say papaya but i get more guava  some grapefruit rind in the back there too  plus a little wheat grain  too  quite a pleasant  layered nose  especially for the style  some leafy hops poke their way through as the beer warms  pine needles too  taste  actually quite gentle for a double ipa  fresh orange juice is definitely there  light white peaches  finishes with a light bitterness and some wheat crispness  feel  medium body  carbonation is spot on  nice and lively  many double ipas are more syrupy than this  so i’m glad to see this working for the beer  makes it quite drinkable  as i’m writing  i find myself agreeing with the tasting notes from the brewer almost exactly  overall  not what i’ve come to expect from a double ipa  my favorite double ipas are definitely more bitter and thicker in mouthfeel so this almost feels like a completely different style of beer and not very much like everybody else’s ipa  it’s damn drinkable though  the nose is great  mouthfeel is wonderful  and it’s probably the best brunch beer i could think of  the only thing holding it back for me is that the taste could be punchier  it is delicious and so easily drinkable  but for a double ipa i think i want just a bit more heft  this feels like a regular ipa  that being said  this is my favorite ipa of the four i’ve tried at tree house        tied for my favorite so far               img  poured into a  oz teku glass canned on     pours a very hazy yellow orange with a massive  finger sticky white head that leaves plenty of thick rings of lace behind    smell guava  passionfruit  apricot  pear  tangerine  and grapefruit rind    taste follows just a tropical bomb  front to back guava  passionfruit especially just explode on your entire palate  with some grapefruit bitterness and tangerine    mouthfeel is bigger than most  moderate carbonation and a soft mouthfeel  a stickyness from the insane amount of fresh hops  and really drinkable at    abv    overall this is just an amazing nedipa and when you are from tree house the expectations get higher and this one lives up to those huge expectations                        excellent juicy citrus with a hint of bitterness  full mouthfeel that is super soft  body matches the flavor with enough sweetness to balance  tangerine and pineapple                 this one is cool because the hop complexion is a little more familiar and old school  its northwestern and spicy and vegetal and piney to me  intense  like a west coast ipa that just also happens to be multigrain and hazy  this one has become famous for them  and i can certainly see why  it should appeal to ipa drinkers of all persuasions  oily and bitter too to an extent that the others i have had from them recently are not  i like this being a little more classically styled in terms of hop flavors  it allows me to easily appreciate what the grain base does for the hops  which is to extend them well beyond just the finish  and to almost balance their intensity with texture not with flavor  which is amazing  this is super soft and round and bubbly and exciting  unique feel for hoppy beer  and these guys have it dialed  grapefruit and orange zest in the nose  fresh pine  resinous and almost concentrated  intense in a delicious way  its not overly complex  but thats part of what makes it  the simplicity is great  its clean and pure and fresh  and while i might not rank it among the best hoppy beer in the world like so many folks here on ba have  i sure enjoyed the can and hope to be able to drink a bit more of this in the future  lucky to have had a friend send me these cans  i really enjoyed all of the tree house ive had recently  and totally see what all the hype is about         unlike lots of dipas  haze did not reek of alcohol nor taste as such  i experienced a delicate balance between  abv and a surprisingly drinkable and dangerous blend of citrus  tropical aroma and welcomed hoppiness      my first experience with this long time whale  canned on    and poured into pint glass  it pours a hazy  dirty golden yellow color with a half finger of milk white head that dissipated slowly leaving a thin sheen of creamy lacing  the smell didn t pop as much as i anticipated but it nonetheless is fragrant with lemon  tangerine  vanilla  pine needles  and floral hops  the taste is everything i d hoped for  a perfect balance of lemon  grapefruit  tangerine  lactose  and a delicious blend of hops that s bitter without biting  this is as easy a drinking dipa as you ll ever find  it s creamy with a near perfect level of carbonation  and it goes down so smooth i can t believe it s    overall  haze is simply exquisite  it richly deserves its world class rating        poured to an ora et labora taster  a  body is superb with opaque matte yellow coloration and a huge cm thick white dense head  you can t get any better than this  s  aroma is very interesting with an agressive hop profile in the beginning  acting more like a green ish approach to the aroma  no citric tones  t  taste is so soft and amazing to a dipa  you wouldn t expect to find this beer so soft on bitterness and sweetness  it s almost an umami like flavour centered in the middle of the beer  it s even a bit spicy towards the end  m  body is medium  carbonation is perfect  just a bit of alcohol noticed in the end towards a more green ish bitterness  o  great and huge beer that is so drinkable for a dipa that it falls under the non imaginable    a  the beer is cloudy yellow in color  it poured with a finger high frothy white head that has excellent retention properties and consistently left a short head covering the surface  s  moderate aromas of citrusy hops are present in the nose—grapefruit seems to stand out in particular  t  the taste has flavors of orange and tangerine citrus as well as tropical fruits such as mangos and passionfruit  no bitterness is perceptible  m  it feels medium bodied and crisp on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation  o  this new england style imperial ipa is very  juicy  and drinks very easily as any traces of alcohol are very well hidden from the taste  it is a definite citrus bomb  note  canned on    serving type  can           poured from the can  pours a very hazy medium straw color with two finger of head  aromas are huge levels of mango  papaya  light candied tangerine  flavors are so delicious tons of fruit  mellow hops  no burn and no bitterness  mouthfeel was incredible so soft and supple  overall  yeah this beer is incredible         a  cloudy  deep gold in color    finger ivory head that receded to a thin cap  nice lacing  s  as the can promises  it s a combination of orange juice  fresh peach  and papaya  not nearly as aromatic as other tree house beers i ve had  t  follows the nose with mild bitterness on the finish  i m used to tree house beers exploding with aroma and flavor   this was somewhat muted  m  medium bodied  moderate carbonation  moderately dry finish  o  enjoyable  but didn t live up to my expectations         wasn t bad  just wasn t amazingly great either    a long time fan of haze but this is the second batch i have had that is just a shadow of its former self  a batch in january  and now this may batch  aroma and taste is muted  i love th consistency but something is up with haze  disappointing     poured from can into tulip  good  finger cream colored soapy head  good retention and good lacing  bright turbid orange in the glass  almost glows  smells of orange  mango   apricot  initial taste follows the nose with the addition of mild grapefruit  slight alcohol on the finish  similar to a mimosa  mouthfeel on this beer is unbelievable  it is thick and rich and creamy     we actually felt bad about using a paper cup this time  for something with such a high abv it tastes like juice in a paper cup    it’s been awhile since i had regular haze  after having said vh was only slightly better  i take that back  vh feels softer  but this has more taste somehow  i notice that classic peach mango flavor much more here                         seriously amazing  dipa but zero heat  sweet  with hints of orange and papaya  nose a bit light compared to the taste but still pleasant  mouth feel is so smooth and fluffy             my favorite tree house beer              typical hazy light orange  pineapple pour  very juicy taste  one of the “sweetest” ipas i’ve had  not a lot of nose though  i was surprised       very good buzz             where did haze go    this beer used to be fire      still one of my favorites    very good  lot of depth  smell was better than the overall taste  not sure how long i would wait in line for it given all the other great local beers but glad to try it     pretty tasty   but is it substantially better than any of the other ne ipas out there  i don t think so  but the can i came across was nearly four months old  so who knows  l  like a light orange juice  thin head and opaque  light orange coloring  s  good smell  but nothing necessarily that the can claimed  i only really picked up light hop flavors  t  again  a good beer  but i don t see how it sets itself apart from much of the pack  at least these days  f  hop oil is all over this one and there isn t any of the thinness you see in some of the more recent ne ipas  strangely  i m a fan of the feel of this beer more than anything else  o  i take nothing away from tree house  as pioneers of this style  but i think the competition has caught up  haze is a good  tasty beer  but i don t think i need to seek out this style from new england               can from jacob    ounce can into tulip glass  canned on     pours opaquely hazy medium orange amber color with a  finger dense and rocky off white head with amazing retention  that reduces to a nice cap that lasts  thick soapy lacing clings on the glass  with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap  fantastic appearance  aromas of big tangerine  grapefruit  orange juice  lemon  lime  peach  pear  pineapple  apricot  passion fruit  papaya  mango  melon  kiwi  guava  berry  citrus peel zest  light pepper pine  wheat  cracker  biscuit  white bread dough  herbal  and floral grassy earthiness  damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus fruity tropical earthy hops and bready malt notes  with great strength  taste of huge tangerine  grapefruit  orange juice  lemon  lime  peach  pear  pineapple  apricot  passion fruit  papaya  mango  melon  kiwi  guava  berry  citrus peel zest  light pepper pine  wheat  cracker  biscuit  white bread dough  herbal  and floral grassy earthiness  very minimal pine  zesty  herbal  grassy  spicy bitterness on the finish  lingering notes of tangerine  grapefruit  orange juice  lemon  lime  peach  pear  pineapple  apricot  passion fruit  papaya  mango  melon  kiwi  guava  berry  citrus peel zest  light pepper pine  wheat  cracker  biscuit  white bread dough  and herbal floral grassy earthiness on the finish for a while  amazing complexity  robustness  and balance of citrus fruity tropical earthy hops and bready malt flavors  with a nice malt bitterness balance  and zero cloying astringent flavors after the finish  medium carbonation and medium plus body  very smooth  creamy  silky  and bready mouthfeel that is insane  light sticky hops and lightly increasing lingering bitter dryness  minimal warming alcohol for     overall this is an insane ne dipa  all around amazing complexity  robustness  and balance of citrus fruity tropical earthy hops and bready malt flavors  very smooth and insanely easy to drink for the abv  with the minimally bitter drying finish  softest of the soft mouthfeel was perfect  insanely juicy and lightly dank hops  balanced bready malts  not overly sweet heavy feeling for the abv  a highly amazing offering  and perfect style example            a   super beautiful hazy  off yellow color  perfect oily lacing s   fruity  reminded me of pineapple  oranges  and passion fruit blended together t   juicy  amazing  and one of the best i ve ever had the pleasure of enjoying  didn t even remind me of an off the shelf double ipa  completely different and i thank tree house for that  f   smooth  but somewhat thick  perfection  i can only describe it as amazingly juicy  phenomenal  if you are lucky enough to see it  buy it  you ll thank me later                       pretty damn dank and juicy  hides it s abv extremely well  smells and tastes like peach and citrus             poured from can to teku  pours hazy orange with white head  head sticks around and laces the glass nicely  aroma is interesting  peachy with hints of grapefruit and tropic citrus fruit  taste is peach and citrus  has a mellow hop bitterness that shines on the back  mouth feel is light and refreshing  definitely one of the easiest    dipas to drink    appearance  poured a yellowish peach color completely hazy with a bright white foamy head  aroma  subtle peach and orange juice  the hops give slight earthy green to the nose  the aromas were a bit more tame than the other tree house dipas i have tried  flavor  tasted peach and oranges with hop bite at the finish  it s starts sweet and juicy but finishes with a slight gritty bitterness  but very balanced overall between the malt and hops  mouthfeel  medium bodied and smooth  almost creamy  quiet similar to those trending milkshake ipa s i have tasted  overall  not the best of the tree house but still world class  it s so balanced  keeps me wanting to take a sip a split second after the other  and i wouldn t have even guessed it was    abv    can to chalice  thick head with lots of retention  lace on glass  hazy orange color  combination of tropical fruit and earthy dankness in the nose  big fruity hop flavor  with grapefruit  orange  melon  followed by similar earthy finish  smooth mouthfeel  very drinkable  excellent dipa      pours a hazy  bright orange coloration with a small  fizzy head  smells intensly of hoppy tropical and citrus aromas  passion fruit  guava  grapefruit and tangerine  taste follows the nose  with a very hop forward  juicy and slightly dank taste of tropical and citrus fruits  passion fruit  guava  grapefruit and tangerine  almost no malt detectable at all  pretty sweet and a little zesty  with a very light bitterness coming through in the aftertaste  v ery nice  smooth and creamy mouthfeel with medium carbonisation  this reminds me a lot of other half double mosaic daydream  without quite reaching its mouthfeel  but a slightly nicer balance and bitterness    pours a bright yellow  clouded color with a one finger broad white head  smells of a tropical mix of grapefruit  passion fruit and fresh squeezed lime pulp  offers a tropical sweetness on the nose  without a hint of malts but a plethora of well diversed hops instead  has a medium  smooth and soft mouthfeel with a long lasting fruitiness and just a dry note during the aftertaste of the beer  tastes of lime pulp  dried oranges and papaya  with a crackery maltiness underneath  has a light effervescence onwards from its mid palate  together with riper turning fruits  finishes calm  well nuanced on the still fruity hops  which add a little bit of sweetness  creating a papaya  passion fruit impression  very hop forward in a tropical ne ipa way  well nuanced with an astonishing depth  resulting seemingly solely from the hops themselves     great straight from the tap at the brewery  definitely drops off after a couple of weeks but one of my favorite beers fresh  the new brewery is awesome too   beautiful pure haze light orange smell is mild but clean and full of fruit creamy feel and full of fruit  not a ton of carbonation but tons of flavor certainly a dipa but easy to drink    have has this beer in cans and on tap  on tap it is as if they put a half inch whipped cream on top  i have tried but cannot seem to recreate this from the can but i get to drink this at home  this review is a combination of what i had on tap and from the can  i would recommend trying both        pours a beautiful hazey golden yellowish color  looks like peach juice  aroma fills the room with notes of peach  orange and passion fruit  the taste follows with peach and orange up front and an oniony dankness on the back end  beautiful creamy mouthfeel  dankness lingers a bit longer than expected and stays with an aftertaste i can do without  leaves beautiful lacing all over the glass  really nice beer overall           hazy  lighter in color  like mango pineapple juice  thin white head  smells is huge citrus  has some tart smell to it as well  taste is tangy citrus  has a slight bitterness that i think goes well with it  mouthfeel soft and dry  overall  i like the slight and balanced bitterness this one brings to the table     pours a hazy orange color with a one inch white head that left gorgeous spots of lacing all the way down the glass  smells of tropical fruits with a hint of orange  tastes of orange  orange peel  peach  mango  a bit of onion and pepper  medium bodied and carbonated  slightly dry mouth feel and mild to medium bitter finish                  golden and hazy  not overly opaque like green  but moderately hazy  with  fingers of whitish head  some chunks of yeast are floating within  nice  chunky lacing as well  smells of dank  tropical fruit  onions and garlic  green leaf  papayas  jackfruit  mangos  cumin and body odour  lighter notes of lemon and oranges are in there too  huge dank and tropical fruit bomb  all the flavours i mentioned on the nose are accelerated on the tongue  more notes of green leaf  catnip  and skunk cabbage are on the tongue  rich  big  smooth and resinous body  moderate to low carbonation  the kind that is light but foams up like a reaction in your mouth  got this january rd at tree house brewery in massachusetts  it was handed for free to me by the guy ahead of me in line  who found out i d travelled from thailand to try tree house brews for the first time  thanks bro from connecticut  whoever you are  drinking by lake muskoka jan nd                    this is in my top three th brews i ve had  along with dopple and green     canned     drank      the yarchives  opaque orange yellow appearance  a rough pour yielded a big white head  thick  frothy lace  orange citrus  apple   banana notes in the nose  soft medium mouthfeel  orange citrus   soft apple flavors up front  smooth banana   faint dry grass notes on the finish  no booze heat  f ruity  balanced   delicious  i hope to have many more                  yum x         looks appetizing  hazy golden straw color  thick and juicy  smell is very nice with hints of mango and other tropicals taste is very good  my third from th and imo equally as good as sap  this one more fruit sap more piney  solid depth of flavor  finishes soft not too bitter  somewhat lasting mild bitterness  feel  medium to heavy body  solidly thick and juicy  classic ne dipa  hazy as advertised  overall  not blown away  not worth a drive from nyc  but so very nice to try and will continue to explore treehouse                                picked up this morning at the brewery s not even a day old  poured into a treehous tulip  look  beautiful trademark treehouse look  as the name says  hazy  one finger bright white head  beautiful opaque light yellow orange  looks like juice  smell  bursting with ripe peach  pineapple  mangos  papaya and every tropical fruit imaginable  taste  so floral  big mango  big pineapple  peach pulp  absolutely killed the flavor of this one two thumbs up  mouthfeel  again classic treehouse beautiful little bubbles rush over every centimeter of your palate and infuse the tropical flavors right into your taste buds  creamy and oily  overall  other then green my favorite regular offering from treehouse  so complex with so many different fruits coming to mind  absolutely love this beer and put it up there with my favorite   thanks treehouse    get your hands on some  '"
